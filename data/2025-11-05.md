Abstract: Recent success with large language models has sparked a new wave of verbal
human-AI interaction. While such models support users in a variety of creative
tasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal
form of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To
explore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an
interactive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an
artificial other by partially mimicking and also "creatively" enhancing an
incoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages
single-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus,
it does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas
of two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to
generate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and
responsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is
demonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature
distribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as
simulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to
creative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations
from the human partner while appearing realistic.

Abstract: Coral reefs support numerous marine organisms and are an important source of
coastal protection from storms and floods, representing a major part of marine
ecosystems. However coral reefs face increasing threats from pollution, ocean
acidification, and sea temperature anomalies, making efficient protection and
monitoring heavily urgent. Therefore, this study presents a novel
machine-learning-based coral bleaching classification system based on a diverse
global dataset with samples of healthy and bleached corals under varying
environmental conditions, including deep seas, marshes, and coastal zones. We
benchmarked and compared three state-of-the-art models: Residual Neural Network
(ResNet), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
After comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, the CNN model achieved the highest
accuracy of 88%, outperforming existing benchmarks. Our findings offer
important insights into autonomous coral monitoring and present a comprehensive
analysis of the most widely used computer vision models.

Abstract: Coral reef monitoring in the Western Indian Ocean is limited by the labor
demands of underwater visual censuses. This work evaluates a YOLOv8-based deep
learning pipeline for automating family-level fish identification from video
transects collected in Kenya and Tanzania. A curated dataset of 24 families was
tested under different configurations, providing the first region-specific
benchmark for automated reef fish monitoring in the Western Indian Ocean. The
best model achieved mAP@0.5 of 0.52, with high accuracy for abundant families
but weaker detection of rare or complex taxa. Results demonstrate the potential
of deep learning as a scalable complement to traditional monitoring methods.

Abstract: Representation learning methods utilizing the InfoNCE loss have demonstrated
considerable capacity in reducing human annotation effort by training invariant
neural feature extractors. Although different variants of the training
objective adhere to the information maximization principle between the data and
learned features, data selection and augmentation still rely on human
hypotheses or engineering, which may be suboptimal. For instance, data
augmentation in contrastive learning primarily focuses on color jittering,
aiming to emulate real-world illumination changes. In this work, we investigate
the potential of selecting training data based on their mutual information
computed from real-world distributions, which, in principle, should endow the
learned features with better generalization when applied in open environments.
Specifically, we consider patches attached to scenes that exhibit high mutual
information under natural perturbations, such as color changes and motion, as
positive samples for learning with contrastive loss. We evaluate the proposed
mutual-information-informed data augmentation method on several benchmarks
across multiple state-of-the-art representation learning frameworks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and establishing it as a promising direction
for future research.

Abstract: Digital image processing involves the systematic handling of images using
advanced computer algorithms, and has gained significant attention in both
academic and practical fields. Image enhancement is a crucial preprocessing
stage in the image-processing chain, improving image quality and emphasizing
features. This makes subsequent tasks (segmentation, feature extraction,
classification) more reliable. Image enhancement is essential for rice leaf
analysis, aiding in disease detection, nutrient deficiency evaluation, and
growth analysis. Denoising followed by contrast enhancement are the primary
steps. Image filters, generally employed for denoising, transform or enhance
visual characteristics like brightness, contrast, and sharpness, playing a
crucial role in improving overall image quality and enabling the extraction of
useful information. This work provides an extensive comparative study of
well-known image-denoising methods combined with CLAHE (Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for efficient denoising of rice leaf images.
The experiments were performed on a rice leaf image dataset to ensure the data
is relevant and representative. Results were examined using various metrics to
comprehensively test enhancement methods. This approach provides a strong basis
for assessing the effectiveness of methodologies in digital image processing
and reveals insights useful for future adaptation in agricultural research and
other domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LiDAR-based roadside perception is a cornerstone of advanced Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS). While considerable research has addressed optimal
LiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR
scanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively
under-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as
traditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive
(e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at
varying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and
overall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these
differences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the "InfraLiDARs'
Benchmark," a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation
environment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting
both scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive
statistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate
the impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D
object detection algorithms. Our findings reveal that non-repetitive scanning
LiDAR and the 128-line repetitive LiDAR were found to exhibit comparable
detection performance across various scenarios. Despite non-repetitive LiDAR's
limited perception range, it's a cost-effective option considering its low
price. Ultimately, this study provides insights for setting up roadside
perception system with optimal LiDAR scanning patterns and compatible
algorithms for diverse roadside applications, and publicly releases the
"InfraLiDARs' Benchmark" dataset to foster further research.

Abstract: We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World
Foundation Models for Physical AI. Built on a flow-based architecture,
[Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation
in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language
model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation.
Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement
learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial
improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment,
with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more
reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop
simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family
with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and
Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than
[Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video
generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and
[Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To
accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code,
pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model
License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and
https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open
resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the
next generation of embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rapid climate change and other disturbances in alpine ecosystems demand
frequent habitat monitoring, yet manual mapping remains prohibitively expensive
for the required temporal resolution. We employ deep learning for change
detection using long-term alpine habitat data from Gesaeuse National Park,
Austria, addressing a major gap in applying geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
to complex natural environments with fuzzy class boundaries and highly
imbalanced classes. We compare two paradigms: post-classification change
detection (CD) versus direct CD. For post-classification CD, we evaluate GFMs
Prithvi-EO-2.0 and Clay v1.0 against U-Net CNNs; for direct CD, we test the
transformer ChangeViT against U-Net baselines. Using high-resolution multimodal
data (RGB, NIR, LiDAR, terrain attributes) covering 4,480 documented changes
over 15.3 km2, results show Clay v1.0 achieves 51% overall accuracy versus
U-Net's 41% for multi-class habitat change, while both reach 67% for binary
change detection. Direct CD yields superior IoU (0.53 vs 0.35) for binary but
only 28% accuracy for multi-class detection. Cross-temporal evaluation reveals
GFM robustness, with Clay maintaining 33% accuracy on 2020 data versus U-Net's
23%. Integrating LiDAR improves semantic segmentation from 30% to 50% accuracy.
Although overall accuracies are lower than in more homogeneous landscapes, they
reflect realistic performance for complex alpine habitats. Future work will
integrate object-based post-processing and physical constraints to enhance
applicability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present LeMiCa, a training-free and efficient acceleration framework for
diffusion-based video generation. While existing caching strategies primarily
focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation
of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated
and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a
directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax
Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error.
This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and
style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video
benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference
speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on
the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming
prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual
quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for
accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can
serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable
video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become the de facto post-training strategy
for large vision-language-action (VLA) models, but its reliance on costly human
demonstrations limits scalability and generalization. We propose Probe, Learn,
Distill (PLD), a three-stage plug-and-play framework that improves VLAs through
residual reinforcement learning (RL) and distribution-aware data collection. In
Stage 1, we train lightweight residual actors to probe failure regions of the
VLA generalist. In Stage 2, we use a hybrid rollout scheme that aligns
collected trajectories with the generalist's deployment distribution while
capturing recovery behaviors. In Stage 3, we distill the curated trajectories
back into the generalist with standard SFT. PLD achieves near-saturated 99%
task success on LIBERO, over 50% gains in SimplerEnv, and 100% success on
real-world Franka and YAM arm manipulation tasks. Ablations show that residual
probing and distribution-aware replay are key to collecting deployment-aligned
data that improves both seen and unseen tasks, offering a scalable path toward
self-improving VLA models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The anatomical structure segmentation of the spine and adjacent structures
from computed tomography (CT) images is a key step for spinal disease diagnosis
and treatment. However, the segmentation of CT images is impeded by low
contrast and complex vertebral boundaries. Although advanced models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in various segmentation tasks,
their performance in spinal CT imaging is limited by high annotation
requirements and poor domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose SpinalSAM-R1, a multimodal vision-language interactive system that
integrates a fine-tuned SAM with DeepSeek-R1, for spine CT image segmentation.
Specifically, our SpinalSAM-R1 introduces an anatomy-guided attention mechanism
to improve spine segmentation performance, and a semantics-driven interaction
protocol powered by DeepSeek-R1, enabling natural language-guided refinement.
The SpinalSAM-R1 is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient
adaptation. We validate our SpinalSAM-R1 on the spine anatomical structure with
CT images. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves superior
segmentation performance. Meanwhile, we develop a PyQt5-based interactive
software, which supports point, box, and text-based prompts. The system
supports 11 clinical operations with 94.3\% parsing accuracy and sub-800 ms
response times. The software is released on

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging
modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural
analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated
by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing
machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is
complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences
with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to
overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised
learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a
video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a
non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a
filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in
SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We
use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network
with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks
were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous
cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test
accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both
considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL
is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed
CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in
self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have become state-of-the-art generative models for images,
audio, and video, yet enabling fine-grained controllable generation, i.e.,
continuously steering specific concepts without disturbing unrelated content,
remains challenging. Concept Sliders (CS) offer a promising direction by
discovering semantic directions through textual contrasts, but they require
per-concept training and architecture-specific fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA),
limiting scalability to new modalities. In this work we introduce FreeSliders,
a simple yet effective approach that is fully training-free and
modality-agnostic, achieved by partially estimating the CS formula during
inference. To support modality-agnostic evaluation, we extend the CS benchmark
to include both video and audio, establishing the first suite for fine-grained
concept generation control with multiple modalities. We further propose three
evaluation properties along with new metrics to improve evaluation quality.
Finally, we identify an open problem of scale selection and non-linear
traversals and introduce a two-stage procedure that automatically detects
saturation points and reparameterizes traversal for perceptually uniform,
semantically meaningful edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method enables plug-and-play, training-free concept control across modalities,
improves over existing baselines, and establishes new tools for principled
controllable generation. An interactive presentation of our benchmark and
method is available at: https://azencot-group.github.io/FreeSliders/

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text to video generation has emerged as a critical frontier in generative
artificial intelligence, yet existing approaches struggle with maintaining
temporal consistency, compositional understanding, and fine grained control
over visual narratives. We present MOVAI (Multimodal Original Video AI), a
novel hierarchical framework that integrates compositional scene understanding
with temporal aware diffusion models for high fidelity text to video synthesis.
Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a Compositional Scene Parser
(CSP) that decomposes textual descriptions into hierarchical scene graphs with
temporal annotations, (2) a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM) that
ensures coherent motion dynamics across frames while preserving spatial
details, and (3) a Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) module that iteratively
enhances video quality through multi-scale temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MOVAI achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving video quality metrics by 15.3% in
LPIPS, 12.7% in FVD, and 18.9% in user preference studies compared to existing
methods. Our framework shows particular strength in generating complex
multi-object scenes with realistic temporal dynamics and fine-grained semantic
control.

Abstract: We propose a novel cognitively-inspired method to improve and interpret
physical simulation in vision-language models. Our ``Chain of Time" method
involves generating a series of intermediate images during a simulation, and it
is motivated by in-context reasoning in machine learning, as well as mental
simulation in humans. Chain of Time is used at inference time, and requires no
additional fine-tuning. We apply the Chain-of-Time method to synthetic and
real-world domains, including 2-D graphics simulations and natural 3-D videos.
These domains test a variety of particular physical properties, including
velocity, acceleration, fluid dynamics, and conservation of momentum. We found
that using Chain-of-Time simulation substantially improves the performance of a
state-of-the-art image generation model. Beyond examining performance, we also
analyzed the specific states of the world simulated by an image model at each
time step, which sheds light on the dynamics underlying these simulations. This
analysis reveals insights that are hidden from traditional evaluations of
physical reasoning, including cases where an image generation model is able to
simulate physical properties that unfold over time, such as velocity, gravity,
and collisions. Our analysis also highlights particular cases where the image
generation model struggles to infer particular physical parameters from input
images, despite being capable of simulating relevant physical processes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) is among the most widely used diagnostic tools in
cardiology for assessing heart health, but its effectiveness is limited by
operator dependence, time constraints, and human error. The shortage of trained
professionals, especially in remote areas, further restricts access. These
issues underscore the need for automated solutions that can ensure consistent,
and accessible cardiac imaging regardless of operator skill or location. Recent
progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), has gained attention for enabling autonomous decision-making.
However, existing DRL-based approaches to cardiac US scanning lack
reproducibility, rely on proprietary data, and use simplified models. Motivated
by these gaps, we present the first end-to-end framework that integrates
generative AI and DRL to enable autonomous and reproducible cardiac US
scanning. The framework comprises two components: (i) a conditional generative
simulator combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), that models the cardiac US environment producing realistic
action-conditioned images; and (ii) a DRL module that leverages this simulator
to learn autonomous, accurate scanning policies. The proposed framework
delivers AI-driven guidance through expert-validated models that classify image
type and assess quality, supports conditional generation of realistic US
images, and establishes a reproducible foundation extendable to other organs.
To ensure reproducibility, a publicly available dataset of real cardiac US
scans is released. The solution is validated through several experiments. The
VAE-GAN is benchmarked against existing GAN variants, with performance assessed
using qualitative and quantitative approaches, while the DRL-based scanning
system is evaluated under varying configurations to demonstrate effectiveness.

Abstract: The primary challenge in computer vision is precisely calculating the pose of
6D objects, however many current approaches are still fragile and have trouble
generalizing from synthetic data to real-world situations with fluctuating
lighting, textureless objects, and significant occlusions. To address these
limitations, VLM6D, a novel dual-stream architecture that leverages the
distinct strengths of visual and geometric data from RGB-D input for robust and
precise pose estimation. Our framework uniquely integrates two specialized
encoders: a powerful, self-supervised Vision Transformer (DINOv2) processes the
RGB modality, harnessing its rich, pre-trained understanding of visual grammar
to achieve remarkable resilience against texture and lighting variations.
Concurrently, a PointNet++ encoder processes the 3D point cloud derived from
depth data, enabling robust geometric reasoning that excels even with the
sparse, fragmented data typical of severe occlusion. These complementary
feature streams are effectively fused to inform a multi task prediction head.
We demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that VLM6D obtained new SOTA
performance on the challenging Occluded-LineMOD, validating its superior

Abstract: Age estimation from facial images is a complex and multifaceted challenge in
computer vision. In this study, we present a novel hybrid architecture that
combines ConvNeXt, a state-of-the-art advancement of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), with Vision Transformers (ViT). While each model independently
delivers excellent performance on a variety of tasks, their integration
leverages the complementary strengths of the CNNs localized feature extraction
capabilities and the Transformers global attention mechanisms. Our proposed
ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid solution was thoroughly evaluated on benchmark age
estimation datasets, including MORPH II, CACD, and AFAD, and achieved superior
performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). To address computational
constraints, we leverage pre-trained models and systematically explore
different configurations, using linear layers and advanced regularization
techniques to optimize the architecture. Comprehensive ablation studies
highlight the critical role of individual components and training strategies,
and in particular emphasize the importance of adapted attention mechanisms
within the CNN framework to improve the model focus on age-relevant facial
features. The results show that the ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid not only outperforms
traditional methods, but also provides a robust foundation for future advances
in age estimation and related visual tasks. This work underscores the
transformative potential of hybrid architectures and represents a promising
direction for the seamless integration of CNNs and transformers to address
complex computer vision challenges.

Abstract: Recent studies in long video understanding have harnessed the advanced
visual-language reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs),
driving the evolution of video-LMMs specialized for processing extended video
sequences. However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the
overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token
compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled
approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse
subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual
tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves
remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens,
drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing
near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free,
model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that
seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive
evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and
LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent
compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness
in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its
efficiency in processing speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have increased the exposure of
powerful image editing techniques as a tool, raising concerns about their
potential for malicious use. An emerging line of research to address such
threats focuses on implanting "protective" adversarial noise into images before
their public release, so future attempts to edit them using text-to-image
models can be impeded. However, subsequent works have shown that these
adversarial noises are often easily "reversed," e.g., with techniques as simple
as JPEG compression, casting doubt on the practicality of the approach. In this
paper, we argue that adversarial noise for image protection should not only be
imperceptible, as has been a primary focus of prior work, but also
irreversible, viz., it should be difficult to detect as noise provided that the
original image is hidden. We propose a surprisingly simple method to enhance
the robustness of image protection methods against noise reversal techniques.
Specifically, it applies an adaptive per-region Gaussian blur on the noise to
adjust the overall frequency spectrum. Through extensive experiments, we show
that our method consistently improves the per-sample worst-case protection
performance of existing methods against a wide range of reversal techniques on
diverse image editing scenarios, while also reducing quality degradation due to
noise in terms of perceptual metrics. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Visual compliance verification is a critical yet underexplored problem in
computer vision, especially in domains such as media, entertainment, and
advertising where content must adhere to complex and evolving policy rules.
Existing methods often rely on task-specific deep learning models trained on
manually labeled datasets, which are costly to build and limited in
generalizability. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer
broad real-world knowledge and policy understanding, they struggle to reason
over fine-grained visual details and apply structured compliance rules
effectively on their own. In this paper, we propose CompAgent, the first
agentic framework for visual compliance verification. CompAgent augments MLLMs
with a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW
detectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that
dynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A
verification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to
perform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
CompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and
curated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement
over the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate
the effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for
scalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI-generated images poses unprecedented challenges to
information integrity and media authenticity. Existing detection approaches
suffer from fundamental limitations: traditional classifiers lack
interpretability and fail to generalize across evolving generative models,
while vision-language models (VLMs), despite their promise, remain constrained
to single-shot analysis and pixel-level reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce AIFo (Agent-based Image Forensics), a novel training-free
framework that emulates human forensic investigation through multi-agent
collaboration. Unlike conventional methods, our framework employs a set of
forensic tools, including reverse image search, metadata extraction,
pre-trained classifiers, and VLM analysis, coordinated by specialized LLM-based
agents that collect, synthesize, and reason over cross-source evidence. When
evidence is conflicting or insufficient, a structured multi-agent debate
mechanism allows agents to exchange arguments and reach a reliable conclusion.
Furthermore, we enhance the framework with a memory-augmented reasoning module
that learns from historical cases to improve future detection accuracy. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans 6,000 images across both controlled laboratory
settings and challenging real-world scenarios, including images from modern
generative platforms and diverse online sources. AIFo achieves 97.05% accuracy,
substantially outperforming traditional classifiers and state-of-the-art VLMs.
These results demonstrate that agent-based procedural reasoning offers a new
paradigm for more robust, interpretable, and adaptable AI-generated image
detection.

Abstract: The vision community is undergoing the unprecedented progress with the
emergence of Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLMs). Prompt learning plays
as the holy grail of accessing VLMs since it enables their fast adaptation to
downstream tasks with limited resources. Whereas existing researches milling
around single-prompt paradigms, rarely investigate the technical potential
behind their multi-prompt learning counterparts. This paper aims to provide a
principled retrospect for vision-language multi-prompt learning. We extend the
recent constant modality gap phenomenon to learnable prompts and then, justify
the superiority of vision-language transfer with multi-prompt augmentation,
empirically and theoretically. In terms of this observation, we propose an
Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt
embeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is
implicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but
also rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain
open-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted
to justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of satellite Internet with low-Earth-orbit (LEO)
satellites in mega-constellations allows ubiquitous connectivity to rural and
remote areas. However, weather events have a significant impact on the
performance and reliability of satellite Internet. Adverse weather events such
as snow and rain can disturb the performance and operations of satellite
Internet's essential ground terminal components, such as satellite antennas,
significantly disrupting the space-ground link conditions between LEO
satellites and ground stations. This challenge calls for not only region-based
weather forecasts but also fine-grained detection capability on ground terminal
components of fine-grained weather conditions. Such a capability can assist in
fault diagnostics and mitigation for reliable satellite Internet, but its
solutions are lacking, not to mention the effectiveness and generalization that
are essential in real-world deployments. This paper discusses an efficient
transfer learning (TL) method that can enable a ground component to locally
detect representative weather-related conditions. The proposed method can
detect snow, wet, and other conditions resulting from adverse and typical
weather events and shows superior performance compared to the typical deep
learning methods, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN, and R-YOLO. Our TL
method also shows the advantage of being generalizable to various scenarios.

Abstract: Cell segmentation in single-shot quantitative phase microscopy (ssQPM) faces
challenges from traditional thresholding methods that are sensitive to noise
and cell density, while deep learning approaches using simple channel
concatenation fail to exploit the complementary nature of polarized intensity
images and phase maps. We introduce DM-QPMNet, a dual-encoder network that
treats these as distinct modalities with separate encoding streams. Our
architecture fuses modality-specific features at intermediate depth via
multi-head attention, enabling polarized edge and texture representations to
selectively integrate complementary phase information. This content-aware
fusion preserves training stability while adding principled multi-modal
integration through dual-source skip connections and per-modality normalization
at minimal overhead. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over
monolithic concatenation and single-modality baselines, showing that
modality-specific encoding with learnable fusion effectively exploits ssQPM's
simultaneous capture of complementary illumination and phase cues for robust
cell segmentation.

Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem aims to find the most efficient mapping
between two probability distributions under a given cost function, and has
diverse applications in many fields such as machine learning, computer vision
and computer graphics. However, existing methods for computing optimal
transport maps are primarily developed for Euclidean spaces and the sphere. In
this paper, we explore the problem of computing the optimal transport map in
hyperbolic space, which naturally arises in contexts involving hierarchical
data, networks, and multi-genus Riemann surfaces. We propose a novel and
efficient algorithm for computing the optimal transport map in hyperbolic space
using a geometric variational technique by extending methods for Euclidean and
spherical geometry to the hyperbolic setting. We also perform experiments on
synthetic data and multi-genus surface models to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have enabled the generation of
high-quality videos. However, these videos still suffer from unrealistic
deformations, semantic violations, and physical inconsistencies that are
largely rooted in the absence of 3D physical priors. To address these
challenges, we propose an object-aware 4D human motion generation framework
grounded in 3D Gaussian representations and motion diffusion priors. With
pre-generated 3D humans and objects, our method, Motion Score Distilled
Interaction (MSDI), employs the spatial and prompt semantic information in
large language models (LLMs) and motion priors through the proposed Motion
Diffusion Score Distillation Sampling (MSDS). The combination of MSDS and LLMs
enables our spatial-aware motion optimization, which distills score gradients
from pre-trained motion diffusion models, to refine human motion while
respecting object and semantic constraints. Unlike prior methods requiring
joint training on limited interaction datasets, our zero-shot approach avoids
retraining and generalizes to out-of-distribution object aware human motions.
Experiments demonstrate that our framework produces natural and physically
plausible human motions that respect 3D spatial context, offering a scalable
solution for realistic 4D generation.

Abstract: In the single-positive multi-label (SPML) setting, each image in a dataset is
labeled with the presence of a single class, while the true presence of other
classes remains unknown. The challenge is to narrow the performance gap between
this partially-labeled setting and fully-supervised learning, which often
requires a significant annotation budget. Prior SPML methods were developed and
benchmarked on synthetic datasets created by randomly sampling single positive
labels from fully-annotated datasets like Pascal VOC, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and
CUB200. However, this synthetic approach does not reflect real-world scenarios
and fails to capture the fine-grained complexities that can lead to difficult
misclassifications. In this work, we introduce the L48 dataset, a fine-grained,
real-world multi-label dataset derived from recordings of bird sounds. L48
provides a natural SPML setting with single-positive annotations on a
challenging, fine-grained domain, as well as two extended settings in which
domain priors give access to additional negative labels. We benchmark existing
SPML methods on L48 and observe significant performance differences compared to
synthetic datasets and analyze method weaknesses, underscoring the need for
more realistic and difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: In entomology and ecology research, biologists often need to collect a large
number of insects, among which beetles are the most common species. A common
practice for biologists to organize beetles is to place them on trays and take
a picture of each tray. Given the images of thousands of such trays, it is
important to have an automated pipeline to process the large-scale data for
further research. Therefore, we develop a 3-stage pipeline to detect all the
beetles on each tray, sort and crop the image of each beetle, and do
morphological segmentation on the cropped beetles. For detection, we design an
iterative process utilizing a transformer-based open-vocabulary object detector
and a vision-language model. For segmentation, we manually labeled 670 beetle
images and fine-tuned two variants of a transformer-based segmentation model to
achieve fine-grained segmentation of beetles with relatively high accuracy. The
pipeline integrates multiple deep learning methods and is specialized for
beetle image processing, which can greatly improve the efficiency to process
large-scale beetle data and accelerate biological research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D point cloud registration underpins reliable image-guided
colonoscopy, directly affecting lesion localization, margin assessment, and
navigation safety. However, biological tissue exhibits repetitive textures and
locally homogeneous geometry that cause feature degeneracy, while substantial
domain shifts between pre-operative anatomy and intra-operative observations
further degrade alignment stability. To address these clinically critical
challenges, we introduce a novel 3D registration method tailored for endoscopic
navigation and a high-quality, clinically grounded dataset to support rigorous
and reproducible benchmarking. We introduce C3VD-Raycasting-10k, a large-scale
benchmark dataset with 10,014 geometrically aligned point cloud pairs derived
from clinical CT data. We propose MambaNetLK, a novel correspondence-free
registration framework, which enhances the PointNetLK architecture by
integrating a Mamba State Space Model (SSM) as a cross-modal feature extractor.
As a result, the proposed framework efficiently captures long-range
dependencies with linear-time complexity. The alignment is achieved iteratively
using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. On the clinical dataset, C3VD-Raycasting-10k,
MambaNetLK achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, reducing median rotation error by 56.04% and RMSE translation error by
26.19% over the second-best method. The model also demonstrates strong
generalization on ModelNet40 and superior robustness to initial pose
perturbations. MambaNetLK provides a robust foundation for 3D registration in
surgical navigation. The combination of a globally expressive SSM-based feature
extractor and a large-scale clinical dataset enables more accurate and reliable
guidance systems in minimally invasive procedures like colonoscopy.

Abstract: Humans excel at visual social inference, the ability to infer hidden elements
of a scene from subtle behavioral cues such as other people's gaze, pose, and
orientation. This ability drives everyday social reasoning in humans and is
critical for developing more human-like AI agents. We introduce Spot The Ball,
a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual social inference in
vision-language models (VLMs) using sports as a test domain. The task is to
localize a removed sports ball from soccer, basketball, and volleyball images.
We present a curated evaluation set with human baselines and a scalable
pipeline for generating additional test items. We evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini, GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) using three prompting
strategies, finding that humans are consistently two to three times more
accurate (20-34%) than models ($\leq$ 17%) across all sports. Our analyses show
that models rely on superficial spatial heuristics--such as guessing near the
image center or nearby players--while humans leverage social cues like gaze
direction and body pose. These findings reveal a persistent human-model gap in
visual social reasoning and underscore the need for architectures that
explicitly encode structured behavioral cues to achieve robust, human-like
inference.

Abstract: Accurate classification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture, enabling
applications such as crop monitoring, fruit recognition, and pest detection.
However, conventional centralized training often requires large-scale data
collection, which raises privacy concerns, while standard federated learning
struggles with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and
incurs high communication costs. To address these challenges, we propose a
federated learning framework that integrates a frozen Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision transformer (ViT) with a lightweight
transformer classifier. By leveraging the strong feature extraction capability
of the pre-trained CLIP ViT, the framework avoids training large-scale models
from scratch and restricts federated updates to a compact classifier, thereby
reducing transmission overhead significantly. Furthermore, to mitigate
performance degradation caused by non-IID data distribution, a small subset
(1%) of CLIP-extracted feature representations from all classes is shared
across clients. These shared features are non-reversible to raw images,
ensuring privacy preservation while aligning class representation across
participants. Experimental results on agricultural classification tasks show
that the proposed method achieve 86.6% accuracy, which is more than 4 times
higher compared to baseline federated learning approaches. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of combining vision-language model features
with federated learning for privacy-preserving and scalable agricultural
intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in personalized generative models demonstrate impressive

generated image, nor generate consistent multiple views of the person. To
address this problem, we propose a lightweight adaptation method, PersonalView,
capable of enabling an existing model to acquire multi-view generation
capability with as few as 100 training samples. PersonalView consists of two
key components: First, we design a conditioning architecture to take advantage
of the in-context learning ability of the pre-trained diffusion transformer.
Second, we preserve the original generative ability of the pretrained model
with a new Semantic Correspondence Alignment Loss. We evaluate the multi-view
consistency, text alignment, identity similarity, and visual quality of
PersonalView and compare it to recent baselines with potential capability of
multi-view customization. PersonalView significantly outperforms baselines
trained on a large corpus of multi-view data with only 100 training samples.

Abstract: Petrography is a branch of geology that analyzes the mineralogical
composition of rocks from microscopical thin section samples. It is essential
for understanding rock properties across geology, archaeology, engineering,
mineral exploration, and the oil industry. However, petrography is a
labor-intensive task requiring experts to conduct detailed visual examinations
of thin section samples through optical polarization microscopes, thus
hampering scalability and highlighting the need for automated techniques. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Large-scale Imaging and Thin section
Optical-polarization Set (LITHOS), the largest and most diverse publicly
available experimental framework for automated petrography. LITHOS includes
211,604 high-resolution RGB patches of polarized light and 105,802
expert-annotated grains across 25 mineral categories. Each annotation consists
of the mineral class, spatial coordinates, and expert-defined major and minor
axes represented as intersecting vector paths, capturing grain geometry and
orientation. We evaluate multiple deep learning techniques for mineral
classification in LITHOS and propose a dual-encoder transformer architecture
that integrates both polarization modalities as a strong baseline for future
reference. Our method consistently outperforms single-polarization models,
demonstrating the value of polarization synergy in mineral classification. We
have made the LITHOS Benchmark publicly available, comprising our dataset,
code, and pretrained models, to foster reproducibility and further research in
automated petrographic analysis.

Abstract: Lightweight vision classification models such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and
EfficientNet are increasingly deployed in mobile and embedded systems, yet
their performance has been predominantly benchmarked on ImageNet. This raises
critical questions: Do models that excel on ImageNet also generalize across
other domains? How can cross-dataset robustness be systematically quantified?
And which architectural elements consistently drive generalization under tight
resource constraints? Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of 11
lightweight vision models (2.5M parameters), trained under a fixed 100-epoch
schedule across 7 diverse datasets. We introduce the Cross-Dataset Score
(xScore), a unified metric that quantifies the consistency and robustness of
model performance across diverse visual domains. Our results show that (1)
ImageNet accuracy does not reliably predict performance on fine-grained or
medical datasets, (2) xScore provides a scalable predictor of mobile model
performance that can be estimated from just four datasets, and (3) certain
architectural components--such as isotropic convolutions with higher spatial
resolution and channel-wise attention--promote broader generalization, while
Transformer-based blocks yield little additional benefit, despite incurring
higher parameter overhead. This study provides a reproducible framework for
evaluating lightweight vision models beyond ImageNet, highlights key design
principles for mobile-friendly architectures, and guides the development of
future models that generalize robustly across diverse application domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) enhances emotional
understanding through the fusion of multimodal signals. However, unpredictable
modality absence in real-world scenarios significantly degrades the performance
of existing methods. Conventional missing-modality recovery approaches, which
depend on training with complete multimodal data, often suffer from semantic
distortion under extreme data distributions, such as fixed-modality absence. To
address this, we propose the Federated Dialogue-guided and Semantic-Consistent
Diffusion (FedDISC) framework, pioneering the integration of federated learning
into missing-modality recovery. By federated aggregation of modality-specific
diffusion models trained on clients and broadcasting them to clients missing
corresponding modalities, FedDISC overcomes single-client reliance on modality
completeness. Additionally, the DISC-Diffusion module ensures consistency in
context, speaker identity, and semantics between recovered and available
modalities, using a Dialogue Graph Network to capture conversational
dependencies and a Semantic Conditioning Network to enforce semantic alignment.
We further introduce a novel Alternating Frozen Aggregation strategy, which
cyclically freezes recovery and classifier modules to facilitate collaborative
optimization. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP, CMUMOSI, and CMUMOSEI
datasets demonstrate that FedDISC achieves superior emotion classification
performance across diverse missing modality patterns, outperforming existing
approaches.

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date geospatial data are essential for urban planning,
infrastructure monitoring, and environmental management. Yet, automating urban
monitoring remains difficult because curated datasets of specific urban
features and their changes are scarce. We introduce OSMGen, a generative
framework that creates realistic satellite imagery directly from raw
OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Unlike prior work that relies on raster tiles, OSMGen
uses the full richness of OSM JSON, including vector geometries, semantic tags,
location, and time, giving fine-grained control over how scenes are generated.
A central feature of the framework is the ability to produce consistent
before-after image pairs: user edits to OSM inputs translate into targeted
visual changes, while the rest of the scene is preserved. This makes it
possible to generate training data that addresses scarcity and class imbalance,
and to give planners a simple way to preview proposed interventions by editing
map data. More broadly, OSMGen produces paired (JSON, image) data for both
static and changed states, paving the way toward a closed-loop system where
satellite imagery can automatically drive structured OSM updates. Source code
is available at https://github.com/amir-zsh/OSMGen.

Abstract: The rapid rise of generative diffusion models has made distinguishing
authentic visual content from synthetic imagery increasingly challenging.
Traditional deepfake detection methods, which rely on frequency or pixel-level
artifacts, fail against modern text-to-image systems such as Stable Diffusion
and DALL-E that produce photorealistic and artifact-free results. This paper
introduces a diffusion-based forensic framework that leverages multi-strength
image reconstruction dynamics, termed diffusion snap-back, to identify
AI-generated images. By analysing how reconstruction metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and
PSNR) evolve across varying noise strengths, we extract interpretable
manifold-based features that differentiate real and synthetic images. Evaluated
on a balanced dataset of 4,000 images, our approach achieves 0.993 AUROC under
cross-validation and remains robust to common distortions such as compression
and noise. Despite using limited data and a single diffusion backbone (Stable
Diffusion v1.5), the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization and
interpretability, offering a foundation for scalable, model-agnostic synthetic
media forensics.

Abstract: Onboard cloud segmentation is a critical yet underexplored task in thermal
Earth observation (EO), particularly for CubeSat missions constrained by
limited hardware and spectral information. CubeSats often rely on a single
thermal band and lack sufficient labeled data, making conventional cloud
masking techniques infeasible. This work addresses these challenges by applying
transfer learning to thermal cloud segmentation for the FOREST-2 CubeSat, using
a UNet with a lightweight MobileNet encoder. We pretrain the model on the
public Landsat-7 Cloud Cover Assessment Dataset and fine-tune it with a small
set of mission-specific samples in a joint-training setup, improving the macro
F1 from 0.850 to 0.877 over FOREST-2-only baselines. We convert the model to a
TensorRT engine and demonstrate full-image inference in under 5 seconds on an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano. These results show that leveraging public datasets and
lightweight architectures can enable accurate, efficient thermal-only cloud
masking on-orbit, supporting real-time decision-making in data-limited EO
missions.

Abstract: Cultural heritage restoration in Bangladesh faces a dual challenge of limited
resources and scarce technical expertise. Traditional 3D digitization methods,
such as photogrammetry or LiDAR scanning, require expensive hardware, expert
operators, and extensive on-site access, which are often infeasible in
developing contexts. As a result, many of Bangladesh's architectural treasures,
from the Paharpur Buddhist Monastery to Ahsan Manzil, remain vulnerable to
decay and inaccessible in digital form. This paper introduces Oitijjo-3D, a
cost-free generative AI framework that democratizes 3D cultural preservation.
By using publicly available Google Street View imagery, Oitijjo-3D reconstructs
faithful 3D models of heritage structures through a two-stage pipeline -
multimodal visual reasoning with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for structure-texture
synthesis, and neural image-to-3D generation through Hexagen for geometry
recovery. The system produces photorealistic, metrically coherent
reconstructions in seconds, achieving significant speedups compared to
conventional Structure-from-Motion pipelines, without requiring any specialized
hardware or expert supervision. Experiments on landmarks such as Ahsan Manzil,
Choto Sona Mosque, and Paharpur demonstrate that Oitijjo-3D preserves both
visual and structural fidelity while drastically lowering economic and
technical barriers. By turning open imagery into digital heritage, this work
reframes preservation as a community-driven, AI-assisted act of cultural
continuity for resource-limited nations.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval uses a text query to locate a moment from a given
untrimmed video reference. Locating corresponding video moments with text
queries helps people interact with videos efficiently. Current solutions for
this task have not considered conflict within location results from different
models, so various models cannot integrate correctly to produce better results.
This study introduces a reinforcement learning-based video moment retrieval
model that can scan the whole video once to find the moment's boundary while
producing its locational evidence. Moreover, we proposed a multi-agent system
framework that can use evidential learning to resolve conflicts between agents'
localization output. As a side product of observing and dealing with conflicts
between agents, we can decide whether a query has no corresponding moment in a
video (out-of-scope) without additional training, which is suitable for
real-world applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the
effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, the results of our study reveal that modeling
competition and conflict of the multi-agent system is an effective way to
improve RL performance in moment retrieval and show the new role of evidential
learning in the multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Widespread clinical deployment of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is
hindered by the challenge of integrating with existing hospital IT
infrastructure. Here, we introduce VisionCAD, a vision-based radiological
assistance framework that circumvents this barrier by capturing medical images
directly from displays using a camera system. The framework operates through an
automated pipeline that detects, restores, and analyzes on-screen medical
images, transforming camera-captured visual data into diagnostic-quality images
suitable for automated analysis and report generation. We validated VisionCAD
across diverse medical imaging datasets, demonstrating that our modular
architecture can flexibly utilize state-of-the-art diagnostic models for
specific tasks. The system achieves diagnostic performance comparable to
conventional CAD systems operating on original digital images, with an F1-score
degradation typically less than 2\% across classification tasks, while natural
language generation metrics for automated reports remain within 1\% of those
derived from original images. By requiring only a camera device and standard
computing resources, VisionCAD offers an accessible approach for AI-assisted
diagnosis, enabling the deployment of diagnostic capabilities in diverse
clinical settings without modifications to existing infrastructure.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous
research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a
pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression
recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more
unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting
conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats,
enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference.
However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their
performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art
MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while
MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant
limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce
post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale
datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K
for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively.
Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model
termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source
generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).

Abstract: Multimodal code generation has garnered significant interest within the
research community. Despite the notable success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like Chart-to-code generation, their
reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that
hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode
\textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a
unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a
two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised
Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving
direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we
introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a
coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating
visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments
on various multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our
coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy. The code and model will be available at

Abstract: We present the first unified framework that jointly handles three
operationally heterogeneous saliency tasks, eg, SOD, CoSOD, and SIS, by casting
each as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process in a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) to bridge task heterogeneity. CoT training follows a two-stage paradigm:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To enhance CoT
quality in RL, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a
lightweight single-sample algorithm that leverages the discrepancy between
reward and model confidence as a per-sample advantage signal. This design
naturally focuses updates on informative responses while eliminating group
sampling, thereby addressing GRPO's key limitations: confidence-agnostic
learning, signal dilution, and prohibitive computational overhead. We also
introduce an "output-to-reasoning" strategy to construct high-fidelity SFT data
that ensures logical consistency with ground-truth masks. Experiments show our
model matches or outperforms specialized SOTA methods and strong closed-source
VLMs across all tasks, especially achieving an S-measure of 0.899 on CoCA for
CoSOD, surpassing the prior best by 8.0 percentage points, despite using far
less training data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale pretraining in natural language processing
have enabled pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP to effectively
align images and text, significantly improving performance in zero-shot image
classification tasks. Subsequent studies have further demonstrated that
cropping images into smaller regions and using large language models to
generate multiple descriptions for each caption can further enhance model
performance. However, due to the inherent sensitivity of CLIP, random image
crops can introduce misinformation and bias, as many images share similar
features at small scales. To address this issue, we propose
Localized-Globalized Cross-Alignment (LGCA), a framework that first captures
the local features of an image and then repeatedly selects the most salient
regions and expands them. The similarity score is designed to incorporate both
the original and expanded images, enabling the model to capture both local and
global features while minimizing misinformation. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical analysis demonstrating that the time complexity of LGCA remains the
same as that of the original model prior to the repeated expansion process,
highlighting its efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method substantially improves zero-shot performance across diverse
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake
images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently.
Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification
task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained
detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of
generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a
multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned
with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we
propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the
image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative
clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and
captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the
usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment
scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object
described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local
semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with
impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but the
generated high-quality images raise concerns about potential malicious use.
Existing detectors often struggle to capture discriminative clues across
different models and settings, limiting their generalization to unseen
diffusion models and robustness to various perturbations. To address this
issue, we observe that diffusion-generated images exhibit progressively larger
differences from natural real images across low- to high-frequency bands. Based
on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective representation by enhancing
the Frequency Forgery Clue (F^2C) across all frequency bands. Specifically, we
introduce a frequency-selective function which serves as a weighted filter to
the Fourier spectrum, suppressing less discriminative bands while enhancing
more informative ones. This approach, grounded in a comprehensive analysis of
frequency-based differences between natural real and diffusion-generated
images, enables general detection of images from unseen diffusion models and
provides robust resilience to various perturbations. Extensive experiments on
various diffusion-generated image datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors with superior generalization and
robustness.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly
advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale
web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on
uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor
risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the
text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for
generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the
pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic
misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the
scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively
applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background
content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that
generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive
experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP
achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while
bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses. The source code can be

Abstract: This study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia

ViT-B16 under identical training conditions with focal loss and patient-wise
splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results on the Kermany CXR dataset
demonstrate that ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 achieve the best overall test
accuracy of 98\%, ROC-AUC = 0.997, and F1 = 0.987, while MobileNet-V2 provides
an optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Grad-CAM
visualizations confirm that the proposed models focus on clinically relevant
lung regions, supporting the use of interpretable AI for radiological
diagnostics. This work highlights the potential of weakly supervised
explainable models that enhance pneumonia screening transparency, and clinical
trust in AI-assisted medical imaging.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vestibular schwannoma (VS) on Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is essential for patient management but often requires
time-intensive manual annotations by experts. While recent advances in deep
learning (DL) have facilitated automated segmentation, challenges remain in
achieving robust performance across diverse datasets and complex clinical
cases. We present an annotated dataset stemming from a bootstrapped DL-based
framework for iterative segmentation and quality refinement of VS in MRI. We
combine data from multiple centres and rely on expert consensus for
trustworthiness of the annotations. We show that our approach enables effective
and resource-efficient generalisation of automated segmentation models to a
target data distribution. The framework achieved a significant improvement in
segmentation accuracy with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) increase from
0.9125 to 0.9670 on our target internal validation dataset, while maintaining
stable performance on representative external datasets. Expert evaluation on
143 scans further highlighted areas for model refinement, revealing nuanced
cases where segmentation required expert intervention. The proposed approach is
estimated to enhance efficiency by approximately 37.4% compared to the
conventional manual annotation process. Overall, our human-in-the-loop model
training approach achieved high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
potential as a clinically adaptable and generalisable strategy for automated VS
segmentation in diverse clinical settings. The dataset includes 190 patients,
with tumour annotations available for 534 longitudinal contrast-enhanced

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FedMGP, a new paradigm for personalized federated
prompt learning in vision-language models. FedMGP equips each client with
multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to
capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity
loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and
complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a
broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a
dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic
sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups
and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a
softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially
aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of
underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common
knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter
efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters
among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that
our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning
by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior
approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse
federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on
https://github.com/weihao-bo/FedMGP.git.

Abstract: We introduce Diff4Splat, a feed-forward method that synthesizes controllable
and explicit 4D scenes from a single image. Our approach unifies the generative
priors of video diffusion models with geometry and motion constraints learned
from large-scale 4D datasets. Given a single input image, a camera trajectory,
and an optional text prompt, Diff4Splat directly predicts a deformable 3D
Gaussian field that encodes appearance, geometry, and motion, all in a single
forward pass, without test-time optimization or post-hoc refinement. At the
core of our framework lies a video latent transformer, which augments video
diffusion models to jointly capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict
time-varying 3D Gaussian primitives. Training is guided by objectives on
appearance fidelity, geometric accuracy, and motion consistency, enabling
Diff4Splat to synthesize high-quality 4D scenes in 30 seconds. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Diff4Splatacross video generation, novel view synthesis,
and geometry extraction, where it matches or surpasses optimization-based
methods for dynamic scene synthesis while being significantly more efficient.

Abstract: We present VinDr-CXR-VQA, a large-scale chest X-ray dataset for explainable
Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) with spatial grounding. The dataset
contains 17,597 question-answer pairs across 4,394 images, each annotated with
radiologist-verified bounding boxes and clinical reasoning explanations. Our
question taxonomy spans six diagnostic types-Where, What, Is there, How many,
Which, and Yes/No-capturing diverse clinical intents. To improve reliability,
we construct a balanced distribution of 41.7% positive and 58.3% negative
samples, mitigating hallucinations in normal cases. Benchmarking with
MedGemma-4B-it demonstrates improved performance (F1 = 0.624, +11.8% over
baseline) while enabling lesion localization. VinDr-CXR-VQA aims to advance

Abstract: This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery,
which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV),
resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT
methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily
under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space,
and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a
feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory
cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly
alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations,
FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization
and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an
ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts
design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift.
Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end
and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a
balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous
evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for
panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and
BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets
span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a
challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments
on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and
+43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack. Datasets and code will be

Abstract: Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce
high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image,
limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel
framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation
from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it
requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects
and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve
the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos,
ID-Composer designs a hierarchical identity-preserving attention mechanism,
which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects and
modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user intention,
we introduce semantic understanding via pretrained vision-language model (VLM),
leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding to provide fine-grained
guidance and capture complex interactions between multiple subjects.
Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in aligning the critical
concepts like subject ID, we employ an online reinforcement learning phase to
drive the overall training objective of ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods in identity
preservation, temporal consistency, and video quality.

Abstract: Vision language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in zero
shot classification, but remain susceptible to spurious correlations, where
irrelevant visual features influence predictions. Existing debiasing methods
often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform
fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world
settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still
depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their
generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time
debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training
or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation
model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target
regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific
text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding
visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds
and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing
approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable
and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video
segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring,
anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are
semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional
VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided
Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD)
that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate
fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly
Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings,
guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in
videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of
anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by
demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and
67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset,

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for enhancing operational
safety, ensuring product quality, and optimizing manufacturing efficiency
across global industries. However, the IAD algorithms are severely constrained
by the limitations of existing public benchmarks. Current datasets exhibit
restricted category diversity and insufficient scale, frequently resulting in
metric saturation and limited model transferability to real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce Real-IAD Variety, the largest and most diverse
IAD benchmark, comprising 198,960 high-resolution images across 160 distinct
object categories. Its diversity is ensured through comprehensive coverage of
28 industries, 24 material types, and 22 color variations. Our comprehensive
experimental analysis validates the benchmark's substantial challenge:
state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection methods experience
significant performance degradation when scaled from 30 to 160 categories.
Crucially, we demonstrate that vision-language models exhibit remarkable
robustness to category scale-up, with minimal performance variation across
different category counts, significantly enhancing generalization capabilities
in diverse industrial contexts. The unprecedented scale and complexity of
Real-IAD Variety position it as an essential resource for training and
evaluating next-generation foundation models for anomaly detection. By
providing this comprehensive benchmark with rigorous evaluation protocols
across multi-class unsupervised, multi-view, and zero-/few-shot settings, we
aim to accelerate research beyond domain-specific constraints, enabling the
development of scalable, general-purpose anomaly detection systems. Real-IAD
Variety will be made publicly available to facilitate innovation in this
critical field.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for precise learning and synthesizing
multi-instance semantics from a single image. The difficulty of this problem
lies in the limited training data, and it becomes even more challenging when
the instances to be learned have similar semantics or appearance. To address
this, we propose a penalty-based attention optimization to disentangle similar
semantics during the learning stage. Then, in the synthesis, we introduce and
optimize box control in attention layers to further mitigate semantic leakage
while precisely controlling the output layout. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves disentangled and high-quality semantic learning and
synthesis, strikingly balancing editability and instance consistency. Our
method remains robust when dealing with semantically or visually similar
instances or rare-seen objects. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves efficient rendering for novel
view synthesis, extending it to dynamic scenes still results in substantial
memory overhead from replicating Gaussians across frames. To address this
challenge, we propose 4D Neural Voxel Splatting (4D-NVS), which combines
voxel-based representations with neural Gaussian splatting for efficient
dynamic scene modeling. Instead of generating separate Gaussian sets per
timestamp, our method employs a compact set of neural voxels with learned
deformation fields to model temporal dynamics. The design greatly reduces
memory consumption and accelerates training while preserving high image
quality. We further introduce a novel view refinement stage that selectively
improves challenging viewpoints through targeted optimization, maintaining
global efficiency while enhancing rendering quality for difficult viewing
angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches with significant memory reduction and faster training, enabling
real-time rendering with superior visual fidelity.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to leverage labeled samples from
known categories to cluster unlabeled data that may include both known and
unknown categories. While existing methods have achieved impressive results
under standard conditions, their performance often deteriorates in the presence
of distribution shifts. In this paper, we explore a more realistic task:
Domain-Shifted Generalized Category Discovery (DS\_GCD), where the unlabeled
data includes not only unknown categories but also samples from unknown
domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
\textbf{\underline{F}}requency-guided Gene\textbf{\underline{r}}alized
Cat\textbf{\underline{e}}gory Discov\textbf{\underline{e}}ry framework (FREE)
that enhances the model's ability to discover categories under distributional
shift by leveraging frequency-domain information. Specifically, we first
propose a frequency-based domain separation strategy that partitions samples
into known and unknown domains by measuring their amplitude differences. We
then propose two types of frequency-domain perturbation strategies: a
cross-domain strategy, which adapts to new distributions by exchanging
amplitude components across domains, and an intra-domain strategy, which
enhances robustness to intra-domain variations within the unknown domain.
Furthermore, we extend the self-supervised contrastive objective and semantic
clustering loss to better guide the training process. Finally, we introduce a
clustering-difficulty-aware resampling technique to adaptively focus on
harder-to-cluster categories, further enhancing model performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the impact of
distributional shifts across various benchmark datasets and achieves superior
performance in discovering both known and unknown categories.

Abstract: Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal
evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other
context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context,
which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life
situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection
challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by
correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in
real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating
temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time
zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve
90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art
among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high
precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing
cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity
anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in
real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: How far are deep models from real-world video anomaly understanding (VAU)?
Current works typically emphasize on detecting unexpected occurrences deviated
from normal patterns or comprehending anomalous events with interpretable
descriptions. However, they exhibit only a superficial comprehension of
real-world anomalies, with limited breadth in complex principles and subtle
context that distinguish the anomalies from normalities, e.g., climbing cliffs
with safety gear vs. without it. To this end, we introduce CueBench, the first
of its kind Benchmark, devoted to Context-aware video anomalies within a
Unified Evaluation framework. We comprehensively establish an event-centric
hierarchical taxonomy that anchors two core event types: 14 conditional and 18
absolute anomaly events, defined by their refined semantics from diverse
contexts across 174 scenes and 198 attributes. Based on this, we propose to
unify and benchmark context-aware VAU with various challenging tasks across
recognition, temporal grounding, detection, and anticipation. This also serves
as a rigorous and fair probing evaluation suite for generative-discriminative
as well as generalized-specialized vision-language models (VLMs). To address
the challenges underlying CueBench, we further develop Cue-R1 based on R1-style
reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable, task-aligned, and hierarchy-refined
rewards in a unified generative manner. Extensive results on CueBench reveal
that, existing VLMs are still far from satisfactory real-world anomaly
understanding, while our Cue-R1 surpasses these state-of-the-art approaches by
over 24% on average.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding surgical instrument-tissue interactions requires not only
identifying which instrument performs which action on which anatomical target,
but also grounding these interactions spatially within the surgical scene.
Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learning
from frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specific
instrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarily
relied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustness
required for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address this
gap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instance
segmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task which
produces spatially grounded <instrument, verb, target> outputs.We start by
presenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000
annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb and
anatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark for
strongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learn
triplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture that
extends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address the
challenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomy
priors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition,
detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistently
improves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that strong
instance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhances
the accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Triplet
segmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgical
action triplets. The proposed benchmark and architecture pave the way for more
interpretable, surgical scene understanding.

Abstract: Individual tree segmentation (ITS) from LiDAR point clouds is fundamental for
applications such as forest inventory, carbon monitoring and biodiversity
assessment. Traditionally, ITS has been achieved with unsupervised
geometry-based algorithms, while more recent advances have shifted toward
supervised deep learning (DL). In the past, progress in method development was
hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets, and the availability of
novel data formats, particularly multispectral (MS) LiDAR, remains limited to
this day, despite evidence that MS reflectance can improve the accuracy of ITS.
This study introduces FGI-EMIT, the first large-scale MS airborne laser
scanning benchmark dataset for ITS. Captured at wavelengths 532, 905, and 1,550
nm, the dataset consists of 1,561 manually annotated trees, with a particular
focus on small understory trees. Using FGI-EMIT, we comprehensively benchmarked
four conventional unsupervised algorithms and four supervised DL approaches.
Hyperparameters of unsupervised methods were optimized using a Bayesian
approach, while DL models were trained from scratch. Among the unsupervised
methods, Treeiso achieved the highest test set F1-score of 52.7%. The DL
approaches performed significantly better overall, with the best model,
ForestFormer3D, attaining an F1-score of 73.3%. The most significant difference
was observed in understory trees, where ForestFormer3D exceeded Treeiso by 25.9
percentage points. An ablation study demonstrated that current DL-based
approaches generally fail to leverage MS reflectance information when it is
provided as additional input features, although single channel reflectance can
improve accuracy marginally, especially for understory trees. A performance
analysis across point densities further showed that DL methods consistently
remain superior to unsupervised algorithms, even at densities as low as 10
points/m$^2$.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging suffers from substantial data heterogeneity and
the absence of standardized contrast labels across scanners, protocols, and
institutions, which severely limits large-scale automated analysis. A unified
representation of MRI contrast would enable a wide range of downstream
utilities, from automatic sequence recognition to harmonization and quality
control, without relying on manual annotations. To this end, we introduce
MR-CLIP, a metadata-guided framework that learns MRI contrast representations
by aligning volumetric images with their DICOM acquisition parameters. The
resulting embeddings shows distinct clusters of MRI sequences and outperform
supervised 3D baselines under data scarcity in few-shot sequence
classification. Moreover, MR-CLIP enables unsupervised data quality control by
identifying corrupted or inconsistent metadata through image-metadata embedding
distances. By transforming routinely available acquisition metadata into a
supervisory signal, MR-CLIP provides a scalable foundation for label-efficient
MRI analysis across diverse clinical datasets.

Abstract: Quantization techniques, including quantization-aware training (QAT) and
post-training quantization (PTQ), have become essential for inference
acceleration of image super-resolution (SR) networks. Compared to QAT, PTQ has
garnered significant attention as it eliminates the need for ground truth and
model retraining. However, existing PTQ methods for SR often fail to achieve
satisfactory performance as they overlook the impact of outliers in activation.
Our empirical analysis reveals that these prevalent activation outliers are
strongly correlated with image color information, and directly removing them
leads to significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a
dual-region quantization strategy that partitions activations into an outlier
region and a dense region, applying uniform quantization to each region
independently to better balance bit-width allocation. Furthermore, we observe
that different network layers exhibit varying sensitivities to quantization,
leading to different levels of performance degradation. To address this, we
introduce sensitivity-aware finetuning that encourages the model to focus more
on highly sensitive layers, further enhancing quantization performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing PTQ
approaches across various SR networks and datasets, while achieving performance
comparable to QAT methods in most scenarios with at least a 75 speedup.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, while proficient at generating high-fidelity
images, often suffer from limited output diversity, hindering their application
in exploratory and ideation tasks. Existing prompt optimization techniques
typically target aesthetic fitness or are ill-suited to the creative visual
domain. To address this shortcoming, we introduce WANDER, a novelty
search-based approach to generating diverse sets of images from a single input
prompt. WANDER operates directly on natural language prompts, employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) for semantic evolution of diverse sets of images, and
using CLIP embeddings to quantify novelty. We additionally apply emitters to
guide the search into distinct regions of the prompt space, and demonstrate
that they boost the diversity of the generated images. Empirical evaluations
using FLUX-DEV for generation and GPT-4o-mini for mutation demonstrate that
WANDER significantly outperforms existing evolutionary prompt optimization
baselines in diversity metrics. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of
emitters.

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging is widely used to reduce radiation exposure to
mitigate high exposure side effects, but often suffers from noise and artifacts
that affect diagnostic accuracy. To tackle this issue, deep learning models
have been developed to enhance LDCT images. Various loss functions have been
employed, including classical approaches such as Mean Square Error and
adversarial losses, as well as customized loss functions(LFs) designed for
specific architectures. Although these models achieve remarkable performance in
terms of PSNR and SSIM, these metrics are limited in their ability to reflect
perceptual quality, especially for medical images. In this paper, we focus on
one of the most critical elements of DL-based architectures, namely the loss
function. We conduct an objective analysis of the relevance of different loss
functions for LDCT image quality enhancement and their consistency with image
quality metrics. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between LFs and quality
metrics, and highlight the need of consideration of image quality metrics when
developing a new loss function for image quality enhancement.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in diagnosing Alzheimer's
disease (AD) using neuroimaging data, particularly 18F-FDG PET scans, with
training datasets largely composed of North American cohorts such as those in
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). However, their
generalization to underrepresented populations remains underexplored. In this
study, we benchmark convolutional and Transformer-based models on the ADNI
dataset and assess their generalization performance on a novel Latin American
clinical cohort from the FLENI Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We show
that while all models achieve high AUCs on ADNI (up to .96, .97), their
performance drops substantially on FLENI (down to .82, .80, respectively),
revealing a significant domain shift. The tested architectures demonstrated
similar performance, calling into question the supposed advantages of
transformers for this specific task. Through ablation studies, we identify
per-image normalization and a correct sampling selection as key factors for
generalization. Occlusion sensitivity analysis further reveals that models
trained on ADNI, generally attend to canonical hypometabolic regions for the AD
class, but focus becomes unclear for the other classes and for FLENI scans.
These findings highlight the need for population-aware validation of diagnostic
AI models and motivate future work on domain adaptation and cohort
diversification.

discrete location labels to LiDAR scans and trains an encoder-decoder model to
classify each scan's position directly. We evaluate this approach on the
NuScenes dataset and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to
contrastive learning-based methods while offering advantages in training
efficiency and stability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social media has exacerbated the promotion of Western beauty norms, leading
to negative self-image, particularly in women and girls, and causing harm such
as body dysmorphia. Increasingly content on the internet has been artificially
generated, leading to concerns that these norms are being exaggerated. The aim
of this work is to study how generative AI models may encode 'beauty' and erase
'ugliness', and discuss the implications of this for society. To investigate
these aims, we create two image generation pipelines: a text-to-image model and
a text-to-language model-to image model. We develop a structured beauty
taxonomy which we use to prompt three language models (LMs) and two
text-to-image models to cumulatively generate 5984 images using our two
pipelines. We then recruit women and non-binary social media users to evaluate
1200 of the images through a Likert-scale within-subjects study. Participants
show high agreement in their ratings. Our results show that 86.5% of generated
images depicted people with lighter skin tones, 22% contained explicit content
despite Safe for Work (SFW) training, and 74% were rated as being in a younger
age demographic. In particular, the images of non-binary individuals were rated
as both younger and more hypersexualised, indicating troubling intersectional
effects. Notably, prompts encoded with 'negative' or 'ugly' beauty traits (such
as "a wide nose") consistently produced higher Not SFW (NSFW) ratings
regardless of gender. This work sheds light on the pervasive demographic biases
related to beauty standards present in generative AI models -- biases that are
actively perpetuated by model developers, such as via negative prompting. We
conclude by discussing the implications of this on society, which include
pollution of the data streams and active erasure of features that do not fall
inside the stereotype of what is considered beautiful by developers.

Abstract: Durian plantation suffers from animal intrusions that cause crop damage and
financial loss. The traditional farming practices prove ineffective due to the
unavailability of monitoring without human intervention. The fast growth of
machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to new ways to
detect animals. However, current systems are limited by dependence on single
object detection algorithms, less accessible notification platforms, and
limited deterrent mechanisms. This research suggests an IoT-enabled animal
detection system for durian crops. The system integrates YOLOv5 and SSD object
detection algorithms to improve detection accuracy. The system provides
real-time monitoring, with detected intrusions automatically reported to
farmers via Telegram notifications for rapid response. An automated sound
mechanism (e.g., tiger roar) is triggered once the animal is detected. The
YOLO+SSD model achieved accuracy rates of elephant, boar, and monkey at 90%,
85% and 70%, respectively. The system shows the highest accuracy in daytime and
decreases at night, regardless of whether the image is still or a video.
Overall, this study contributes a comprehensive and practical framework that
combines detection, notification, and deterrence, paving the way for future
innovations in automated farming solutions.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is an important task for real-world applications. To
avoid costly manual annotations, existing methods have explored generating
pseudo labels by transferring 2D masks from foundation models to 3D. However,
this approach is often suboptimal since the video frames are processed
independently. This causes inconsistent segmentation granularity and
conflicting 3D pseudo labels, which degrades the accuracy of final
segmentation. To address this, we introduce a Granularity-Consistent automatic
2D Mask Tracking approach that maintains temporal correspondences across
frames, eliminating conflicting pseudo labels. Combined with a three-stage
curriculum learning framework, our approach progressively trains from
fragmented single-view data to unified multi-view annotations, ultimately
globally coherent full-scene supervision. This structured learning pipeline
enables the model to progressively expose to pseudo-labels of increasing
consistency. Thus, we can robustly distill a consistent 3D representation from
initially fragmented and contradictory 2D priors. Experimental results
demonstrated that our method effectively generated consistent and accurate 3D
segmentations. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art
results on standard benchmarks and open-vocabulary ability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple institutions to cooperatively train
machine learning models while retaining sensitive data at the source, which has
great utility in privacy-sensitive environments. However, FL systems remain
vulnerable to membership-inference attacks and data heterogeneity. This paper
presents FedOnco-Bench, a reproducible benchmark for privacy-aware FL using
synthetic oncologic CT scans with tumor annotations. It evaluates segmentation
performance and privacy leakage across FL methods: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, and
FedAvg with DP-SGD. Results show a distinct trade-off between privacy and
utility: FedAvg is high performance (Dice around 0.85) with more privacy
leakage (attack AUC about 0.72), while DP-SGD provides a higher level of
privacy (AUC around 0.25) at the cost of accuracy (Dice about 0.79). FedProx
and FedBN offer balanced performance under heterogeneous data, especially with
non-identical distributed client data. FedOnco-Bench serves as a standardized,
open-source platform for benchmarking and developing privacy-preserving FL
methods for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled remarkable
medical image editing capabilities. However, the research community's progress
remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly
accessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict
anatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a
comprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing
spanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23
disease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image
to generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical
images. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets
is our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge
with a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural
plausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative
refinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K
includes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference
learning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically
validated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a
foundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image
editing models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use
agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions.
Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically
formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly
generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and
computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to
first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the
precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that
general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their
attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free
supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns
the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals.
These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by
multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides,
its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage.
GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional
data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native
grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among
3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 58.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 62.2%
on OSWorld-G. Project page: https://github.com/sjz5202/GUI-AIMA

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pancreas segmentation in medical image processing is a persistent challenge
due to its small size, low contrast against adjacent tissues, and significant
topological variations. Traditional level set methods drive boundary evolution
using gradient flows, often ignoring pointwise topological effects. Conversely,
deep learning-based segmentation networks extract rich semantic features but
frequently sacrifice structural details. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
model named TA-LSDiff, which combined topology-aware diffusion probabilistic
model and level set energy, achieving segmentation without explicit geometric
evolution. This energy function guides implicit curve evolution by integrating
the input image and deep features through four complementary terms. To further
enhance boundary precision, we introduce a pixel-adaptive refinement module
that locally modulates the energy function using affinity weighting from
neighboring evidence. Ablation studies systematically quantify the contribution
of each proposed component. Evaluations on four public pancreas datasets
demonstrate that TA-LSDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming
existing methods. These results establish TA-LSDiff as a practical and accurate
solution for pancreas segmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various multimodal tasks, where position encoding plays a vital role in
modeling both the sequential structure of textual information and the spatial
structure of visual information. However, current VLMs commonly adopt
modality-unified 1D or 2D positional indexing strategies, which treat textual
and visual tokens uniformly without accounting for their distinct structural
properties and sequential continuity for text and spatial coherence for vision.
To address this limitation, we propose OMEGA, a novel position encoding
framework that employs Modality-Specific Position Encoding (MSPE) to assign
positional indices while preserving the inherent structures of each modality
across separate coordinate dimensions. Additionally, to align the information
density of multimodal data in the positional index space, OMEGA introduces
Global Adaptive Encoding Step Scaling (GAESS), which adaptively adjusts the
position encoding step size of visual tokens based on the embedding entropy of
both modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that OMEGA consistently
enhances VLM performance across diverse architectures and VQA benchmarks. On
visual-intensive tasks, OMEGA achieves up to 3.43% improvement over baseline
position encoding strategies on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, with consistent gains observed
across larger models including Qwen2.5-VL-7B and LLaVA-v1.5-7B.

Abstract: Visual-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved significant
performance across various downstream tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples. While prior efforts focus on improving the adversarial
transferability of multimodal adversarial examples through cross-modal
interactions, these approaches suffer from overfitting issues, due to a lack of
input diversity by relying excessively on information from adversarial examples
in one modality when crafting attacks in another. To address this issue, we
draw inspiration from strategies in some adversarial training methods and
propose a novel attack called Local Shuffle and Sample-based Attack (LSSA).
LSSA randomly shuffles one of the local image blocks, thus expanding the
original image-text pairs, generating adversarial images, and sampling around
them. Then, it utilizes both the original and sampled images to generate the
adversarial texts. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that LSSA significantly enhances the transferability of multimodal
adversarial examples across diverse VLP models and downstream tasks. Moreover,
LSSA outperforms other advanced attacks on Large Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a universal backbone for both image
recognition and image generation. Yet their Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)
layer still performs a quadratic query-key interaction for every token pair,
spending the bulk of computation on visually weak or redundant correlations. We
introduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that
injects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical
complexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's
dense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens,
then splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose
differential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from
another. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone,
requires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA
lifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and
improves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in
class-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points
across both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models. Extensive ablations confirm
that (i) spatial pooling supplies low-variance global cues, (ii) dual
positional embeddings are indispensable for contrastive reasoning, and (iii)
combining the two in both stages yields the strongest synergy. VCA therefore
offers a simple path towards faster and sharper Vision Transformers. The source

Abstract: Though deep neural networks exhibit superior performance on various tasks,
they are still plagued by adversarial examples. Adversarial training has been
demonstrated to be the most effective method to defend against adversarial
attacks. However, existing adversarial training methods show that the model
robustness has apparent oscillations and overfitting issues in the training
process, degrading the defense efficacy. To address these issues, we propose a
novel framework called Parameter Interpolation Adversarial Training (PIAT).
PIAT tunes the model parameters between each epoch by interpolating the
parameters of the previous and current epochs. It makes the decision boundary
of model change more moderate and alleviates the overfitting issue, helping the
model converge better and achieving higher model robustness. In addition, we
suggest using the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) to further improve the
robustness by aligning the relative magnitude of logits between clean and
adversarial examples rather than the absolute magnitude. Extensive experiments
conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework could
prominently improve the robustness of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Abstract: Brain imaging analysis is vital for diagnosing and treating brain disorders,
and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly assisting in that
analysis. However, current brain-oriented visual question-answering (VQA)
benchmarks either cover a few imaging modalities or are limited to
coarse-grained pathological descriptions, hindering a comprehensive assessment
of MLLMs throughout the full clinical continuum. To address these, we introduce
OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal VQA benchmark specifically
designed to assess the multimodal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs in brain
imaging analysis.OmniBrainBench consists of 15 distinct brain imaging
modalities collected from 30 verified medical sources, yielding 9,527 validated
VQA pairs and 31,706 images. It simulates clinical workflows and encompasses 15
multi-stage clinical tasks rigorously validated by a professional radiologist.
Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source, medical, and
proprietary MLLMs, highlights the substantial challenges posed by
OmniBrainBench. Our experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5)
beat open-source and medical models but lag physicians; (2) medical MLLMs vary
widely in performance; (3) open-source MLLMs trail overall but excel in
specific tasks; (4) MLLMs underperform sharply in complex preoperative tasks,
revealing a visual-to-clinical reasoning gap. OmniBrainBench sets a new
standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in brain imaging analysis,
highlighting gaps compared to expert clinical reasoning. We release it at
benchmark \& code.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intentions is crucial for the navigation of
mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. Although recent deep learning-based
models have shown significant success in forecasting intentions, few consider
incomplete observation under occlusion scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we
propose an Occlusion-Aware Diffusion Model (ODM) that reconstructs occluded
motion patterns and leverages them to guide future intention prediction. During
the denoising stage, we introduce an occlusion-aware diffusion transformer
architecture to estimate noise features associated with occluded patterns,
thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture contextual relationships in
occluded semantic scenarios. Furthermore, an occlusion mask-guided reverse
process is introduced to effectively utilize observation information, reducing
the accumulation of prediction errors and enhancing the accuracy of
reconstructed motion features. The performance of the proposed method under
various occlusion scenarios is comprehensively evaluated and compared with
existing methods on popular benchmarks, namely PIE and JAAD. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more robust
performance than existing methods in the literature.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, transparency in the decision-making of perception
models is critical, as even a single misperception can be catastrophic. Yet
with multi-sensor inputs, it is difficult to determine how each modality
contributes to a prediction because sensor information becomes entangled within
the fusion network. We introduce Layer-Wise Modality Decomposition (LMD), a
post-hoc, model-agnostic interpretability method that disentangles
modality-specific information across all layers of a pretrained fusion model.
To our knowledge, LMD is the first approach to attribute the predictions of a
perception model to individual input modalities in a sensor-fusion system for
autonomous driving. We evaluate LMD on pretrained fusion models under
camera-radar, camera-LiDAR, and camera-radar-LiDAR settings for autonomous
driving. Its effectiveness is validated using structured perturbation-based
metrics and modality-wise visual decompositions, demonstrating practical
applicability to interpreting high-capacity multimodal architectures. Code is

Abstract: Visual geo-localization requires extensive geographic knowledge and

Traditional retrieval methods are constrained by database coverage and quality.
Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning
from image content, yet individual models struggle with diverse geographic
regions and complex scenes. Existing multi-agent systems improve performance
through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They
lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose
\textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph
neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate
relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration,
competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level
debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation
modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution
between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into
enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
effectiveness in various general-domain scenarios, such as visual question
answering and image captioning. Recently, researchers have increasingly focused
on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold
significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents
unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse
modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video
sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across
these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To
address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework
for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities.
Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three
key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data
from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning
with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented
2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing
evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding
benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy
optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical
image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.

Abstract: The problem of zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) has achieved
increasing attention due to its wide applications, e.g. e-commerce. Despite
progress made in this field, previous works suffer from using imbalanced
samples of modalities and inconsistent low-quality information during training,
resulting in sub-optimal performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce an
approach called Dynamic Multi-level Weighted Alignment Network for ZS-SBIR. It
consists of three components: (i) a Uni-modal Feature Extraction Module that
includes a CLIP text encoder and a ViT for extracting textual and visual
tokens, (ii) a Cross-modal Multi-level Weighting Module that produces an
alignment weight list by the local and global aggregation blocks to measure the
aligning quality of sketch and image samples, (iii) a Weighted Quadruplet Loss
Module aiming to improve the balance of domains in the triplet loss.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and
QuickDraw, show our method delivers superior performances over the
state-of-the-art ZS-SBIR methods.

Abstract: We propose EVTAR, an End-to-End Virtual Try-on model with Additional
Reference, that directly fits the target garment onto the person image while
incorporating reference images to enhance try-on accuracy. Most existing
virtual try-on approaches rely on complex inputs such as agnostic person
images, human pose, densepose, or body keypoints, making them labor-intensive
and impractical for real-world applications. In contrast, EVTAR adopts a
two-stage training strategy, enabling simple inference with only the source
image and the target garment inputs. Our model generates try-on results without
masks, densepose, or segmentation maps. Moreover, EVTAR leverages additional
reference images of different individuals wearing the same clothes to preserve
garment texture and fine-grained details better. This mechanism is analogous to
how humans consider reference models when choosing outfits, thereby simulating
a more realistic and high-quality dressing effect. We enrich the training data
with supplementary references and unpaired person images to support these
capabilities. We evaluate EVTAR on two widely used benchmarks and diverse
tasks, and the results consistently validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little
insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise
anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly
localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but
remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning
framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial
localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained
test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling
holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training.
Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal
detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding,
yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot
manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is critical for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis and surgical planning, yet remains challenging due to thin,
branching structures and low texture contrast. While foundation models like the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in generic segmentation, they
perform sub-optimally on vascular structures. In this work, we present VesSAM,
a powerful and efficient framework tailored for 2D vessel segmentation. VesSAM
integrates (1) a convolutional adapter to enhance local texture features, (2) a
multi-prompt encoder that fuses anatomical prompts, including skeletons,
bifurcation points, and segment midpoints, via hierarchical cross-attention,
and (3) a lightweight mask decoder to reduce jagged artifacts. We also
introduce an automated pipeline to generate structured multi-prompt
annotations, and curate a diverse benchmark dataset spanning 8 datasets across
5 imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that VesSAM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT-based SAM variants by over 10% Dice and 13%
IoU, and achieves competitive performance compared to fully fine-tuned methods,
with significantly fewer parameters. VesSAM also generalizes well to
out-of-distribution (OoD) settings, outperforming all baselines in average OoD
Dice and IoU.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data denoising is a persistent challenge across scientific and engineering
domains. Real-world data is frequently corrupted by complex, non-linear noise,
rendering traditional rule-based denoising methods inadequate. To overcome
these obstacles, we propose a novel self-supervised multimodal iterative
denoising (MID) framework. MID models the collected noisy data as a state
within a continuous process of non-linear noise accumulation. By iteratively
introducing further noise, MID learns two neural networks: one to estimate the
current noise step and another to predict and subtract the corresponding noise
increment. For complex non-linear contamination, MID employs a first-order
Taylor expansion to locally linearize the noise process, enabling effective
iterative removal. Crucially, MID does not require paired clean-noisy datasets,
as it learns noise characteristics directly from the noisy inputs. Experiments
across four classic computer vision tasks demonstrate MID's robustness,
adaptability, and consistent state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, MID
exhibits strong performance and adaptability in tasks within the biomedical and
bioinformatics domains.

Abstract: Art authentication of Francisco Goya's works presents complex computational
challenges due to his heterogeneous stylistic evolution and extensive
historical patterns of forgery. We introduce a novel multimodal machine
learning framework that applies identical feature extraction techniques to both
visual and X-ray radiographic images of Goya paintings. The unified feature
extraction pipeline incorporates Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix descriptors,
Local Binary Patterns, entropy measures, energy calculations, and colour
distribution analysis applied consistently across both imaging modalities. The
extracted features from both visual and X-ray images are processed through an
optimised One-Class Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter tuning. Using a
dataset of 24 authenticated Goya paintings with corresponding X-ray images,
split into an 80/20 train-test configuration with 10-fold cross-validation, the
framework achieves 97.8% classification accuracy with a 0.022 false positive
rate. Case study analysis of ``Un Gigante'' demonstrates the practical efficacy
of our pipeline, achieving 92.3% authentication confidence through unified
multimodal feature analysis. Our results indicate substantial performance
improvement over single-modal approaches, establishing the effectiveness of
applying identical computational methods to both visual and radiographic
imagery in art authentication applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: B-mode ultrasound for breast cancer diagnosis faces challenges: speckle,
operator dependency, and indistinct boundaries. Existing deep learning suffers
from single-task learning, architectural constraints (CNNs lack global context,
Transformers local features), and black-box decision-making. These gaps hinder
clinical adoption.
  We propose HyFormer-Net, a hybrid CNN-Transformer for simultaneous
segmentation and classification with intrinsic interpretability. Its
dual-branch encoder integrates EfficientNet-B3 and Swin Transformer via
multi-scale hierarchical fusion blocks. An attention-gated decoder provides
precision and explainability. We introduce dual-pipeline interpretability: (1)
intrinsic attention validation with quantitative IoU verification (mean: 0.86),
and (2) Grad-CAM for classification reasoning.
  On the BUSI dataset, HyFormer-Net achieves Dice Score 0.761 +/- 0.072 and
accuracy 93.2%, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet. Malignant
Recall of 92.1 +/- 2.2% ensures minimal false negatives. Ensemble modeling
yields exceptional Dice 90.2%, accuracy 99.5%, and perfect 100% Malignant
Recall, eliminating false negatives. Ablation studies confirm multi-scale
fusion contributes +16.8% Dice and attention gates add +5.9%.
  Crucially, we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization study for hybrid
CNN-Transformers in breast ultrasound. Zero-shot transfer fails (Dice: 0.058),
confirming domain shift. However, progressive fine-tuning with only 10%
target-domain data (68 images) recovers 92.5% performance. With 50% data, our
model achieves 77.3% Dice, exceeding source-domain performance (76.1%) and
demonstrating true generalization.

Abstract: We present FastBoost, a parameter-efficient neural architecture that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks through a novel Dynamically
Scaled Progressive Attention (DSPA) mechanism. Our design establishes new
efficiency frontiers with: CIFAR-10: 95.57% accuracy (0.85M parameters) and
93.80% (0.37M parameters) CIFAR-100: 81.37% accuracy (0.92M parameters) and
74.85% (0.44M parameters) The breakthrough stems from three fundamental
innovations in DSPA: (1) Adaptive Fusion: Learnt channel-spatial attention
blending with dynamic weights. (2) Phase Scaling: Training-stage-aware
intensity modulation (from 0.5 to 1.0). (3) Residual Adaptation: Self-optimized
skip connections (gamma from 0.5 to 0.72). By integrating DSPA with enhanced
MBConv blocks, FastBoost achieves a 2.1 times parameter reduction over
MobileNetV3 while improving accuracy by +3.2 percentage points on CIFAR-10. The
architecture features dual attention pathways with real-time weight adjustment,
cascaded refinement layers (increasing gradient flow by 12.7%), and a
hardware-friendly design (0.28G FLOPs). This co-optimization of dynamic
attention and efficient convolution operations demonstrates unprecedented
parameter-accuracy trade-offs, enabling deployment in resource-constrained edge
devices without accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Neural image compression (NIC) has become the state-of-the-art for
rate-distortion performance, yet its security vulnerabilities remain
significantly less understood than those of classifiers. Existing adversarial
attacks on NICs are often naive adaptations of pixel-space methods, overlooking
the unique, structured nature of the compression pipeline. In this work, we
propose a more advanced class of vulnerabilities by introducing T-MLA, the
first targeted multiscale log--exponential attack framework. Our approach
crafts adversarial perturbations in the wavelet domain by directly targeting
the quality of the attacked and reconstructed images. This allows for a
principled, offline attack where perturbations are strategically confined to
specific wavelet subbands, maximizing distortion while ensuring perceptual
stealth. Extensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art NIC
architectures on standard image compression benchmarks reveals a large drop in
reconstruction quality while the perturbations remain visually imperceptible.
Our findings reveal a critical security flaw at the core of generative and
content delivery pipelines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of determining an image's geographic origin,
poses significant challenges, largely due to visual similarities across
disparate locations and the large search space. To address these issues, we
propose a hierarchical sequence prediction approach inspired by how humans
narrow down locations from broad regions to specific addresses. Analogously,
our model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a
general region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly
precise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our
method uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially
predicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous
predictions. This procedure mirrors autoregressive text generation in large
language models. Much like in language modeling, final performance depends not
only on training but also on inference-time strategy. We investigate multiple
top-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating
techniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models.
Specifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while
exploring various selection strategies to determine the final output. This
enables the model to manage uncertainty by exploring multiple plausible paths
through the hierarchy. We evaluate our method on the Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k
datasets against two distinct sets of baselines: those that operate without a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and those that leverage one. In the
MLLM-free setting, our model surpasses other comparable baselines on nearly all
metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy gains of up to
13.9%. When augmented with an MLLM, our model outperforms all baselines,
setting a new state-of-the-art across all metrics. The source code is available

Abstract: The emergence of 5G and 6G networks has established network slicing as a
significant part of future service-oriented architectures, demanding refined
identification methods supported by robust datasets. The article presents
SliceVision-F2I, a dataset of synthetic samples for studying feature
visualization in network slicing for next-generation networking systems. The
dataset transforms multivariate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) vectors into
visual representations through four distinct encoding methods: physically
inspired mappings, Perlin noise, neural wallpapering, and fractal branching.
For each encoding method, 30,000 samples are generated, each comprising a raw
KPI vector and a corresponding RGB image at low-resolution pixels. The dataset
simulates realistic and noisy network conditions to reflect operational
uncertainties and measurement imperfections. SliceVision-F2I is suitable for
tasks involving visual learning, network state classification, anomaly
detection, and benchmarking of image-based machine learning techniques applied
to network data. The dataset is publicly available and can be reused in various
research contexts, including multivariate time series analysis, synthetic data
generation, and feature-to-image transformations.

Abstract: This study presents a novel method for diagnosing respiratory diseases using

(EKDE) with a bimodal logistic regression classifier in a
statistical-model-based learning scheme. EKDE's flexibility in modeling data
distributions without assuming specific shapes and its adaptability to pixel
intensity variations make it valuable for extracting key features from medical
images. The method was tested on 13808 randomly selected chest X-rays from the
COVID-19 Radiography Dataset, achieved an accuracy of 70.14%, a sensitivity of
59.26%, and a specificity of 74.18%, demonstrating moderate performance in
detecting respiratory disease while showing room for improvement in
sensitivity. While clinical expertise remains essential for further refining
the model, this study highlights the potential of EKDE-based approaches to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Video transformers have recently demonstrated strong potential for
echocardiogram (echo) analysis, leveraging self-supervised pre-training and
flexible adaptation across diverse tasks. However, like other models operating
on videos, they are prone to learning spurious correlations from non-diagnostic
regions such as image backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we propose the
Video Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that
integrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture. ViACT
represents a deforming anatomical structure as a point set and encodes both its
spatial geometry and corresponding image patches into transformer tokens.
During pre-training, ViACT follows a masked autoencoding strategy that masks
and reconstructs only anatomical patches, enforcing that representation
learning is focused on the anatomical region. The pre-trained model can then be
fine-tuned for tasks localized to this region. In this work we focus on the
myocardium, demonstrating the framework on echo analysis tasks such as left
ventricular ejection fraction (EF) regression and cardiac amyloidosis (CA)
detection. The anatomical constraint focuses transformer attention within the
myocardium, yielding interpretable attention maps aligned with regions of known
CA pathology. Moreover, ViACT generalizes to myocardium point tracking without
requiring task-specific components such as correlation volumes used in
specialized tracking networks.

Abstract: Computer vision applications, especially those using augmented reality
technology, are becoming quite popular in mobile devices. However, this type of
application is known as presenting significant demands regarding resources. In
order to enable its utilization in devices with more modest resources, edge

This work proposes the use of embedded devices with graphics processing units

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved 2D visual understanding, prompting interest in their
application to complex 3D reasoning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether
these models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required
for robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key
requirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce
Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset,
consisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and
corresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage
fine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline
MLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in
significant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is
enhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we
introduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously
learn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking.
Experimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial
reasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and
out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing
foundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics,
autonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Human-interpretable predictions are essential for deploying AI in medical
imaging, yet most interpretable-by-design (IBD) frameworks require concept
annotations for training data, which are costly and impractical to obtain in
clinical contexts. Recent attempts to bypass annotation, such as zero-shot
vision-language models or concept-generation frameworks, struggle to capture
domain-specific medical features, leading to poor reliability. In this paper,
we propose a novel Prior-guided Concept Predictor (PCP), a weakly supervised
framework that enables concept answer prediction without explicit supervision
or reliance on language models. PCP leverages class-level concept priors as
weak supervision and incorporates a refinement mechanism with KL divergence and
entropy regularization to align predictions with clinical reasoning.
Experiments on PH2 (dermoscopy) and WBCatt (hematology) show that PCP improves
concept-level F1-score by over 33% compared to zero-shot baselines, while
delivering competitive classification performance on four medical datasets
(PH2, WBCatt, HAM10000, and CXR4) relative to fully supervised concept
bottleneck models (CBMs) and V-IP.

Abstract: Early and accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps is critical for reducing
colorectal cancer mortality, which has been extensively explored by academia
and industry. However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models
either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins
in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational
complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal
endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a
light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines
depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared
channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On
the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is
introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art
accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is
suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation. The code is publicly

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
seamlessly unifying text and image understanding and generation. However,
prevailing evaluations treat these abilities in isolation, such that tasks with
multimodal inputs and outputs are scored primarily through unimodal reasoning,
i.e., textual benchmarks emphasize language-based reasoning, while visual
benchmarks emphasize reasoning outcomes manifested in the pixels. We introduce
ROVER to address this pressing need to test reciprocal cross-modal reasoning,
the use of one modality to guide, verify, or refine outputs in the other, an
ability central to the vision of unified multimodal intelligence. ROVER is a
human-annotated benchmark that explicitly targets reciprocal cross-modal
reasoning, which contains 1312 tasks grounded in 1876 images, spanning two
complementary settings. Verbally-augmented reasoning for visual generation
evaluates whether models can use verbal prompts and reasoning chains to guide
faithful image synthesis. Visually-augmented reasoning for verbal generation
evaluates whether models can generate intermediate visualizations that
strengthen their own reasoning processes for question answering. Experiments on
17 unified models reveal two key findings: (i) Cross-modal reasoning determines
visual generation quality, with interleaved models significantly outperforming
non-interleaved ones; notably, combining strong unimodal models fails to
achieve comparable reasoning. (ii) Models show dissociation between physical
and symbolic reasoning: they succeed at interpreting perceptual concepts
literally but fail to construct visual abstractions for symbolic tasks, where
faulty reasoning harms performance. These results highlight reciprocal
cross-modal reasoning as a critical frontier for enabling true omnimodal
generation.

Abstract: Computer vision for animals holds great promise for wildlife research but
often depends on large-scale data, while existing collection methods rely on
controlled capture setups. Recent data-driven approaches show the potential of
single-view, non-invasive analysis, yet current animal video datasets are
limited--offering as few as 2.4K 15-frame clips and lacking key processing for
animal-centric 3D/4D tasks. We introduce an automated pipeline that mines
YouTube videos and processes them into object-centric clips, along with
auxiliary annotations valuable for downstream tasks like pose estimation,
tracking, and 3D/4D reconstruction. Using this pipeline, we amass 30K videos
(2M frames)--an order of magnitude more than prior works. To demonstrate its
utility, we focus on the 4D quadruped animal reconstruction task. To support
this task, we present Animal-in-Motion (AiM), a benchmark of 230 manually
filtered sequences with 11K frames showcasing clean, diverse animal motions. We
evaluate state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods on
Animal-in-Motion, finding that 2D metrics favor the former despite unrealistic
3D shapes, while the latter yields more natural reconstructions but scores
lower--revealing a gap in current evaluation. To address this, we enhance a
recent model-free approach with sequence-level optimization, establishing the
first 4D animal reconstruction baseline. Together, our pipeline, benchmark, and
baseline aim to advance large-scale, markerless 4D animal reconstruction and
related tasks from in-the-wild videos. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been widely explored to enhance the
performance of image superresolution (SR). Despite some DWT-based methods
improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing
approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands,
resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed
images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model
based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR). DTWSR incorporates the
superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations
among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and
realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet
Transform to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid tokenization
method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of tokens for
transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both spatial and

variances in low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands, without omitting their
alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with high performance on
both perception quality and fidelity.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) requires fine-grained understanding of human
motion and precise evaluation of pose similarity. This paper proposes a
topology-aware Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, termed GCN-PSN,
which models the human skeleton as a graph to learn discriminative,
topology-sensitive pose embeddings. Using a Siamese architecture trained with a
contrastive regression objective, our method outperforms coordinate-based
baselines and achieves competitive performance on AQA-7 and FineDiving
benchmarks. Experimental results and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of leveraging skeletal topology for pose similarity and action
quality assessment.

Abstract: We introduce MoSa, a novel hierarchical motion generation framework for
text-driven 3D human motion generation that enhances the Vector
Quantization-guided Generative Transformers (VQ-GT) paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine scalable generation process. In MoSa, we propose a Multi-scale
Token Preservation Strategy (MTPS) integrated into a hierarchical residual
vector quantization variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE). MTPS employs
interpolation at each hierarchical quantization to effectively retain
coarse-to-fine multi-scale tokens. With this, the generative transformer
supports Scalable Autoregressive (SAR) modeling, which predicts scale tokens,
unlike traditional methods that predict only one token at each step.
Consequently, MoSa requires only 10 inference steps, matching the number of
RQ-VAE quantization layers. To address potential reconstruction degradation
from frequent interpolation, we propose CAQ-VAE, a lightweight yet expressive
convolution-attention hybrid VQ-VAE. CAQ-VAE enhances residual block design and
incorporates attention mechanisms to better capture global dependencies.
Extensive experiments show that MoSa achieves state-of-the-art generation
quality and efficiency, outperforming prior methods in both fidelity and speed.
On the Motion-X dataset, MoSa achieves an FID of 0.06 (versus MoMask's 0.20)
while reducing inference time by 27 percent. Moreover, MoSa generalizes well to
downstream tasks such as motion editing, requiring no additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: The immense diversity in the culture and culinary of Indian cuisines calls
attention to the major shortcoming of the existing Visual Question
Answering(VQA) systems which are inclined towards the foods from Western
region. Recent attempt towards building a VQA dataset for Indian food is a step
towards addressing this challenge. However, their approach towards VQA follows
a two-step process in which the answer is generated first, followed by the
explanation of the expected answer. In this work, we claim that food VQA
requires to follow a multi-step reasoning process to arrive at an accurate
answer, especially in the context of India food, which involves understanding
complex culinary context and identifying relationships between various food
items. With this hypothesis we create reasoning chains upon the QA with minimal
human intervention. We fine-tune smaller LLMs and VLMs with auto-validated
reasoning chains and further train them using reinforcement learning with
larger data. With augmentation of reasoning chains, we observed accuracy
improvement of an average 10 percentage points on the baseline. We provide
detailed analysis in terms the effect of addition of reasoning chains for the
Indian Food VQA task.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization for
action prediction through large-scale vision-language pretraining. However,
most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and,
consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality
VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded
spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the
sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded
and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors
including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This
image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to
facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and
enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built
on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture
and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate
OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception is
needed to guide the manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate
of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline
models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning
efficiency and stronger generalization capability.

Abstract: Human gaze offers rich supervisory signals for understanding visual attention
in complex visual environments. In this paper, we propose Eyes on Target, a
novel depth-aware and gaze-guided object detection framework designed for
egocentric videos. Our approach injects gaze-derived features into the
attention mechanism of a Vision Transformer (ViT), effectively biasing spatial
feature selection toward human-attended regions. Unlike traditional object
detectors that treat all regions equally, our method emphasises
viewer-prioritised areas to enhance object detection. We validate our method on
an egocentric simulator dataset where human visual attention is critical for
task assessment, illustrating its potential in evaluating human performance in
simulation scenarios. We evaluate the effectiveness of our gaze-integrated
model through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent gains in detection accuracy over gaze-agnostic baselines on both the
custom simulator dataset and public benchmarks, including Ego4D Ego-Motion and
Ego-CH-Gaze datasets. To interpret model behaviour, we also introduce a
gaze-aware attention head importance metric, revealing how gaze cues modulate
transformer attention dynamics.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is required for automated driving models to generalize well
across diverse road conditions. This paper explores a training method for
domain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,
for left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four
training methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.
right-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model
pretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a
model pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian
highways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the
model adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper
compares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and
attention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across
significant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone
worsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but
significantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to
lower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this
approach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on
ResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends. These findings emphasize the
importance of preprocessing techniques, such as flipped-data pretraining,
followed by fine-tuning to improve model adaptation with minimal retraining
requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in medical
image analysis, offering the potential to provide generalizable, task-agnostic
solutions across a wide range of clinical tasks and imaging modalities. Their
capacity to learn transferable representations from large-scale data has the
potential to address the limitations of conventional task-specific models.
However, adaptation of FMs to real-world clinical practice remains constrained
by key challenges, including domain shifts, limited availability of
high-quality annotated data, substantial computational demands, and strict
privacy requirements. This review presents a comprehensive assessment of
strategies for adapting FMs to the specific demands of medical imaging. We
examine approaches such as supervised fine-tuning, domain-specific pretraining,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning, self-supervised learning, hybrid methods, and
multimodal or cross-modal frameworks. For each, we evaluate reported
performance gains, clinical applicability, and limitations, while identifying
trade-offs and unresolved challenges that prior reviews have often overlooked.
Beyond these established techniques, we also highlight emerging directions
aimed at addressing current gaps. These include continual learning to enable
dynamic deployment, federated and privacy-preserving approaches to safeguard
sensitive data, hybrid self-supervised learning to enhance data efficiency,
data-centric pipelines that combine synthetic generation with human-in-the-loop
validation, and systematic benchmarking to assess robust generalization under
real-world clinical variability. By outlining these strategies and associated
research gaps, this review provides a roadmap for developing adaptive,
trustworthy, and clinically integrated FMs capable of meeting the demands of
real-world medical imaging.

Abstract: We review human evaluation practices in automated, speech-driven 3D gesture
generation and find a lack of standardisation and frequent use of flawed
experimental setups. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know
how different methods compare, or what the state of the art is. In order to
address common shortcomings of evaluation design, and to standardise future
user studies in gesture-generation works, we introduce a detailed human
evaluation protocol for the widely-used BEAT2 motion-capture dataset. Using
this protocol, we conduct large-scale crowdsourced evaluation to rank six
recent gesture-generation models -- each trained by its original authors --
across two key evaluation dimensions: motion realism and speech-gesture
alignment. Our results provide strong evidence that 1) newer models do not
consistently outperform earlier approaches; 2) published claims of high motion
realism or speech-gesture alignment may not hold up under rigorous evaluation;
and 3) the field must adopt disentangled assessments of motion quality and
multimodal alignment for accurate benchmarking in order to make progress.
Finally, in order to drive standardisation and enable new evaluation research,
we will release five hours of synthetic motion from the benchmarked models;
over 750 rendered video stimuli from the user studies -- enabling new
evaluations without model reimplementation required -- alongside our
open-source rendering script, and the 16,000 pairwise human preference votes
collected for our benchmark.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality synthesis of
specific subjects, such as identities or objects. This capability, while
unlocking new possibilities in content creation, also introduces significant
privacy risks, as personalization techniques can be misused by malicious users
to generate unauthorized content. Although several studies have attempted to
counter this by generating adversarially perturbed samples designed to disrupt
personalization, they rely on unrealistic assumptions and become ineffective in
the presence of even a few clean images or under simple image transformations.
To address these challenges, we shift the protection target from the images to
the diffusion model itself to hinder the personalization of specific subjects,
through our novel framework called Anti-Personalized Diffusion Models (APDM).
We first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a naive approach of
existing loss functions to diffusion models is inherently incapable of ensuring
convergence for robust anti-personalization. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce Direct Protective Optimization (DPO), a novel loss function that
effectively disrupts subject personalization in the target model without
compromising generative quality. Moreover, we propose a new dual-path
optimization strategy, coined Learning to Protect (L2P). By alternating between
personalization and protection paths, L2P simulates future personalization
trajectories and adaptively reinforces protection at each step. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in preventing unauthorized personalization. The
code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/APDM.

Abstract: Transferable attacks generate adversarial examples on surrogate models to
fool unknown victim models, posing real-world threats and growing research
interest. Despite focusing on flat losses for transferable adversarial
examples, recent studies still fall into suboptimal regions, especially the
flat-yet-sharp areas, termed as deceptive flatness. In this paper, we introduce
a novel black-box gradient-based transferable attack from a perspective of
dual-order information. Specifically, we feasibly propose Adversarial Flatness
(AF) to the deceptive flatness problem and a theoretical assurance for
adversarial transferability. Based on this, using an efficient approximation of
our objective, we instantiate our attack as Adversarial Flatness Attack (AFA),
addressing the altered gradient sign issue. Additionally, to further improve
the attack ability, we devise MonteCarlo Adversarial Sampling (MCAS) by
enhancing the inner-loop sampling efficiency. The comprehensive results on
ImageNet-compatible dataset demonstrate superiority over six baselines,
generating adversarial examples in flatter regions and boosting transferability
across model architectures. When tested on input transformation attacks or the
Baidu Cloud API, our method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Brain lesion segmentation remains challenging due to small, low-contrast
lesions, anisotropic sampling, and cross-slice discontinuities. We propose
CenterMamba-SAM, an end-to-end framework that freezes a pretrained backbone and
trains only lightweight adapters for efficient fine-tuning. At its core is the
CenterMamba encoder, which employs a novel 3x3 corner-axis-center
short-sequence scanning strategy to enable center-prioritized, axis-reinforced,
and diagonally compensated information aggregation. This design enhances
sensitivity to weak boundaries and tiny foci while maintaining sparse yet
effective feature representation. A memory-driven structural prompt generator
maintains a prototype bank across neighboring slices, enabling automatic
synthesis of reliable prompts without user interaction, thereby improving
inter-slice coherence. The memory-augmented multi-scale decoder integrates
memory attention modules at multiple levels, combining deep supervision with
progressive refinement to restore fine details while preserving global
consistency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that
CenterMamba-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain lesion
segmentation.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation degrades in adverse weather because refraction,
scattering, and point dropouts corrupt geometry. Prior work in weather
simulation, mixing-based augmentation, domain randomization, and uncertainty or
boundary regularization improves robustness but still overlooks structural
vulnerabilities near boundaries, corners, and sparse regions. We present a
Light Geometry-aware adapter. The module aligns azimuth and applies horizontal
circular padding to preserve neighbor continuity across the 0~360 degree
wrap-around boundary. A local-window K-Nearest Neighbors gathers nearby points
and computes simple local statistics, which are compressed into compact
geometry-aware cues. During training, these cues drive region-aware
regularization that stabilizes predictions in structurally fragile areas. The
adapter is plug and play, complements augmentation, and can be enabled only
during training with negligible inference cost. We adopt a source-only
cross-weather setup where models train on SemanticKITTI and are evaluated on
SemanticSTF without target labels or fine-tuning. The adapter improves mIoU by
7.9 percentage points over the data-centric augmentation baseline and by 0.6
points over the class-centric regularization baseline. These results indicate
that geometry-driven regularization is a key direction for all-weather LiDAR
segmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) is a crucial multimodal task in
clinical decision support and telemedicine. Recent self-attention based methods
struggle to effectively handle cross-modal semantic alignments between vision
and language. Moreover, classification-based methods rely on predefined answer
sets. Treating this task as a simple classification problem may make it unable
to adapt to the diversity of free-form answers and overlook the detailed
semantic information of free-form answers. In order to tackle these challenges,
we introduce a Cross-Mamba Interaction based Multi-Task Learning (CMI-MTL)
framework that learns cross-modal feature representations from images and
texts. CMI-MTL comprises three key modules: fine-grained visual-text feature
alignment (FVTA), cross-modal interleaved feature representation (CIFR), and
free-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning (FFAE). FVTA extracts the most
relevant regions in image-text pairs through fine-grained visual-text feature
alignment. CIFR captures cross-modal sequential interactions via cross-modal
interleaved feature representation. FFAE leverages auxiliary knowledge from
open-ended questions through free-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning,
improving the model's capability for open-ended Med-VQA. Experimental results
show that CMI-MTL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on three
Med-VQA datasets: VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and OVQA. Furthermore, we conduct more
interpretability experiments to prove the effectiveness. The code is publicly

Abstract: Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive
latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time
interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29
FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a
text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos
that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not
perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher
into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching
Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges
arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1)
bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to
infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error
accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in
computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is
introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with
attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV
cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time
extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation
of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in
motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster,
uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint
trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in
real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ancient Chinese paintings are a valuable cultural heritage that is damaged by
irreversible color degradation. Reviving color-degraded paintings is
extraordinarily difficult due to the complex chemistry mechanism. Progress is
further slowed by the lack of comprehensive, high-quality datasets, which
hampers the creation of end-to-end digital restoration tools. To revive colors,
we propose PRevivor, a prior-guided color transformer that learns from recent
paintings (e.g., Ming and Qing Dynasty) to restore ancient ones (e.g., Tang and
Song Dynasty). To develop PRevivor, we decompose color restoration into two
sequential sub-tasks: luminance enhancement and hue correction. For luminance
enhancement, we employ two variational U-Nets and a multi-scale mapping module
to translate faded luminance into restored counterparts. For hue correction, we
design a dual-branch color query module guided by localized hue priors
extracted from faded paintings. Specifically, one branch focuses attention on
regions guided by masked priors, enforcing localized hue correction, whereas
the other branch remains unconstrained to maintain a global reasoning
capability. To evaluate PRevivor, we conduct extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art colorization methods. The results demonstrate superior
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fine-grained cross-modal alignment aims to establish precise local
correspondences between vision and language, forming a cornerstone for visual
question answering and related multimodal applications. Current approaches face
challenges in addressing patch redundancy and ambiguity, which arise from the
inherent information density disparities across modalities. Recently,
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as promising solutions to
bridge this gap through their robust semantic generation capabilities. However,
the dense textual outputs from MLLMs may introduce conflicts with the original
sparse captions. Furthermore, accurately quantifying semantic relevance between
rich visual patches and concise textual descriptions remains a core challenge.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Semantic-Enhanced Patch
Slimming (SEPS) framework, which systematically addresses patch redundancy and
ambiguity. Our approach employs a two-stage mechanism to integrate unified
semantics from both dense and sparse texts, enabling the identification of
salient visual patches. Additionally, it leverages relevance-aware selection
with mean value computation to highlight crucial patch-word correspondences,
thereby improving cross-modal similarity assessment. Comprehensive experiments
on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets validate that SEPS achieves superior
performance, surpassing existing approaches by 23\%-86\% in rSum across diverse
model architectures, with notable enhancements in text-to-image retrieval
scenarios. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: The increasing realism of generated images has raised significant concerns
about their potential misuse, necessitating robust detection methods. Current
approaches mainly rely on training binary classifiers, which depend heavily on
the quantity and quality of available generated images. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that exploits geometric differences between the data
manifolds of natural and generated images. To exploit this difference, we
employ a pair of functions engineered to yield consistent outputs for natural
images but divergent outputs for generated ones, leveraging the property that
their gradients reside in mutually orthogonal subspaces. This design enables a
simple yet effective detection method: an image is identified as generated if a
transformation along its data manifold induces a significant change in the loss
value of a self-supervised model pre-trained on natural images. Further more,
to address diminishing manifold disparities in advanced generative models, we
leverage normalizing flows to amplify detectable differences by extruding
generated images away from the natural image manifold. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of this method. Code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Single object tracking aims to localize target object with specific reference
modalities (bounding box, natural language or both) in a sequence of specific
video modalities (RGB, RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal or RGB+Event.). Different
reference modalities enable various human-machine interactions, and different
video modalities are demanded in complex scenarios to enhance tracking
robustness. Existing trackers are designed for single or several video
modalities with single or several reference modalities, which leads to separate
model designs and limits practical applications. Practically, a unified tracker
is needed to handle various requirements. To the best of our knowledge, there
is still no tracker that can perform tracking with these above reference
modalities across these video modalities simultaneously. Thus, in this paper,
we present a unified tracker, UniSOT, for different combinations of three
reference modalities and four video modalities with uniform parameters.
Extensive experimental results on 18 visual tracking, vision-language tracking
and RGB+X tracking benchmarks demonstrate that UniSOT shows superior
performance against modality-specific counterparts. Notably, UniSOT outperforms
previous counterparts by over 3.0\% AUC on TNL2K across all three reference
modalities and outperforms Un-Track by over 2.0\% main metric across all three
RGB+X video modalities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have driven substantial
improvements in image editing. However, current generative models still
struggle with handling diverse and complex image editing tasks that require
implicit reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
systematically assess their performance across various reasoning scenarios.
Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-object attribute transformation
in realistic scenarios, which, while effective, encounter two key challenges:
(1) they largely overlook multi-object interactions as well as game-world
scenarios that involve human-defined rules, which are common in real-life
applications; (2) they only rely on textual references to evaluate the
generated images, potentially leading to systematic misjudgments, especially in
complex reasoning scenarios. To this end, this work proposes UniREditBench, a
unified benchmark for reasoning-based image editing evaluation. It comprises
2,700 meticulously curated samples, covering both real- and game-world
scenarios across 8 primary dimensions and 18 sub-dimensions. To improve
evaluation reliability, we introduce multimodal dual-reference evaluation,
providing both textual and ground-truth image references for each sample
assessment. Furthermore, we design an automated multi-scenario data synthesis
pipeline and construct UniREdit-Data-100K, a large-scale synthetic dataset with
high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations. We fine-tune Bagel
on this dataset and develop UniREdit-Bagel, demonstrating substantial
improvements in both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Through
thorough benchmarking of both open-source and closed-source image editing
models, we reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

Abstract: To effectively manage the wastage of perishable fruits, it is crucial to
accurately predict their freshness or shelf life using non-invasive methods
that rely on visual data. In this regard, deep learning techniques can offer a
viable solution. However, obtaining fine-grained fruit freshness labels from
experts is costly, leading to a scarcity of data. Closed proprietary Vision
Language Models (VLMs), such as Gemini, have demonstrated strong performance in
fruit freshness detection task in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.
Nonetheless, food retail organizations are unable to utilize these proprietary
models due to concerns related to data privacy, while existing open-source VLMs
yield sub-optimal performance for the task. Fine-tuning these open-source
models with limited data fails to achieve the performance levels of proprietary
models. In this work, we introduce a Model-Agnostic Ordinal Meta-Learning
(MAOML) algorithm, designed to train smaller VLMs. This approach utilizes
meta-learning to address data sparsity and leverages label ordinality, thereby
achieving state-of-the-art performance in the fruit freshness classification
task under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method achieves an
industry-standard accuracy of 92.71%, averaged across all fruits.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of gastric content from ultrasound is critical for
stratifying aspiration risk at induction of general anesthesia. However,
traditional methods rely on manual tracing of gastric antra and empirical
formulas, which face significant limitations in both efficiency and accuracy.
To address these challenges, a novel two-stage probability map-guided
dual-branch fusion framework (REASON) for gastric content assessment is
proposed. In stage 1, a segmentation model generates probability maps that
suppress artifacts and highlight gastric anatomy. In stage 2, a dual-branch
classifier fuses information from two standard views, right lateral decubitus
(RLD) and supine (SUP), to improve the discrimination of learned features.
Experimental results on a self-collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by a significant
margin. This framework shows great promise for automated preoperative
aspiration risk assessment, offering a more robust, efficient, and accurate
solution for clinical practice.

Abstract: Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an
efficient and reward-free approach to improving video generation quality.
However, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly
developed on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their
ability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data
construction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds
high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and
model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external
annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a
regularization term into the DPO objective to enhance training stability and
generation fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with
multiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three
times higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on
both I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video
generation quality.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been widely used for representing
whole-slide pathology images. However, spatial, semantic, and decision
entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted
cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide
image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a
novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a
latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To
alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual
inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling.
Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect
re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on
multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all
state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned
interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent
decision-making process.

Abstract: Safety and reliability are essential for deploying Visual Question Answering
(VQA) in surgery, where incorrect or ambiguous responses can harm the patient.
Most surgical VQA research focuses on accuracy or linguistic quality while
overlooking safety behaviors such as ambiguity awareness, referral to human
experts, or triggering a second opinion. Inspired by Automatic Failure
Detection (AFD), we study uncertainty estimation as a key enabler of safer
decision making. We introduce Question Aligned Semantic Nearest Neighbor
Entropy (QA-SNNE), a black box uncertainty estimator that incorporates question
semantics into prediction confidence. It measures semantic entropy by comparing
generated answers with nearest neighbors in a medical text embedding space,
conditioned on the question. We evaluate five models, including domain specific
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) models and zero-shot Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), on EndoVis18-VQA and PitVQA. PEFT models
degrade under mild paraphrasing, while LVLMs are more resilient. Across three
LVLMs and two PEFT baselines, QA-SNNE improves AUROC in most in-template
settings and enhances hallucination detection. The Area Under the ROC Curve
(AUROC) increases by 15-38% for zero-shot models, with gains maintained under
out-of-template stress. QA-SNNE offers a practical and interpretable step
toward AFD in surgical VQA by linking semantic uncertainty to question context.
Combining LVLM backbones with question aligned uncertainty estimation can
improve safety and clinician trust. The code and model are available at

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has garnered
significant attention due to its efficiency in compressing models. However,
existing methods typically overlook the relationship between a well-trained NN
and the quantized model, leading to considerable quantization error for PTQ.
However, it is unclear how to efficiently train a model-agnostic neural network
which is tailored for a predefined precision low-bit model. In this paper, we
firstly discover that a flat full precision neural network is crucial for
low-bit quantization. To achieve this, we propose a framework that proactively
pre-conditions the model by measuring and disentangling the error sources.
Specifically, both the Activation Quantization Error (AQE) and the Weight
Quantization Error (WQE) are statistically modeled as independent Gaussian
noises. We study several noise injection optimization methods to obtain a flat
minimum. Experimental results attest to the effectiveness of our approach.
These results open novel pathways for obtaining low-bit PTQ models.

Abstract: Robust feature representations are essential for learning-based Multi-View
Stereo (MVS), which relies on accurate feature matching. Recent MVS methods
leverage Transformers to capture long-range dependencies based on local
features extracted by conventional feature pyramid networks. However, the
quadratic complexity of Transformer-based MVS methods poses challenges to
balance performance and efficiency. Motivated by the global modeling capability
and linear complexity of the Mamba architecture, we propose MVSMamba, the first
Mamba-based MVS network. MVSMamba enables efficient global feature aggregation
with minimal computational overhead. To fully exploit Mamba's potential in MVS,
we propose a Dynamic Mamba module (DM-module) based on a novel
reference-centered dynamic scanning strategy, which enables: (1) Efficient
intra- and inter-view feature interaction from the reference to source views,
(2) Omnidirectional multi-view feature representations, and (3) Multi-scale
global feature aggregation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate MVSMamba
outperforms state-of-the-art MVS methods on the DTU dataset and the
Tanks-and-Temples benchmark with both superior performance and efficiency. The

Abstract: The expansion of instruction-tuning data has enabled foundation language
models to exhibit improved instruction adherence and superior performance
across diverse downstream tasks. Semantically-rich 3D human motion is being
progressively integrated with these foundation models to enhance multimodal
understanding and cross-modal generation capabilities. However, the modality
gap between human motion and text raises unresolved concerns about catastrophic
forgetting during this integration. In addition, developing
autoregressive-compatible pose representations that preserve generalizability
across heterogeneous downstream tasks remains a critical technical barrier. To
address these issues, we propose the Human Motion-Vision-Language Model
(HMVLM), a unified framework based on the Mixture of Expert Low-Rank
Adaption(MoE LoRA) strategy. The framework leverages the gating network to
dynamically allocate LoRA expert weights based on the input prompt, enabling
synchronized fine-tuning of multiple tasks. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting
during instruction-tuning, we introduce a novel zero expert that preserves the
pre-trained parameters for general linguistic tasks. For pose representation,
we implement body-part-specific tokenization by partitioning the human body
into different joint groups, enhancing the spatial resolution of the
representation. Experiments show that our method effectively alleviates
knowledge forgetting during instruction-tuning and achieves remarkable
performance across diverse human motion downstream tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has brought about powerful models that can
handle various tasks, like identifying images and understanding language.
However, adversarial attacks, an unnoticed alteration, can deceive models,
leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, a generative adversarial
attack method is proposed that uses the CLIP model to create highly effective
and visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations. The CLIP model's ability
to align text and image representation helps incorporate natural language
semantics with a guided loss to generate effective adversarial examples that
look identical to the original inputs. This integration allows extensive scene
manipulation, creating perturbations in multi-object environments specifically
designed to deceive multilabel classifiers. Our approach integrates the
concentrated perturbation strategy from Saliency-based Auto-Encoder (SSAE) with
the dissimilar text embeddings similar to Generative Adversarial Multi-Object
Scene Attacks (GAMA), resulting in perturbations that both deceive
classification models and maintain high structural similarity to the original
images. The model was tested on various tasks across diverse black-box victim
models. The experimental results show that our method performs competitively,
achieving comparable or superior results to existing techniques, while
preserving greater visual fidelity.

Abstract: Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle
development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating
them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts
to structure driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a
structured five-layer model to improve the evaluation and generation of rare
scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate
new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous
representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for
every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding
specific to our layer-model. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the
relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation:
the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from
one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic
dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcases both metrics in
different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic
videos generated from structured scenario descriptions. The code and extended
results can be found at https://github.com/Valgiz/5LMSG.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have advanced representation learning through
self-supervised methods. However, existing training pipelines are often
inflexible, domain-specific, or computationally expensive, which limits their
usability across different domains and resource settings. DINO-MX is a modular
and extensible training framework that combines the core principles of DINO,
DINOv2 and DINOv3 within a unified configuration-driven system. It supports a
variety of transformer-based architectures and is fully compatible with the
Hugging Face ecosystem. The framework includes multiple training strategies
such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), layer freezing, and knowledge distillation,
along with support for distributed training through both Distributed Data
Parallel (DDP) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). DINO-MX is designed to
work with both natural and specialized data types, including single- and
multi-channel images. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that
DINO-MX achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing
computational costs. Additionally, it offers interpretability tools and a
label-guided data augmentation method that improves attention-based
localization without the need for extra detection or segmentation heads.
DINO-MX provides a reproducible and scalable foundation for developing,
adapting, and benchmarking self-supervised vision models across a range of

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of medical images is fundamental to tumor diagnosis and

its strong generalization, but most methods follow a
single-point-to-single-object paradigm, which limits multi-lesion segmentation.
Moreover, ViT backbones capture global context but often miss high-fidelity
local details. We propose MIQ-SAM3D, a multi-instance 3D segmentation framework
with a competitive query optimization strategy that shifts from
single-point-to-single-mask to single-point-to-multi-instance. A
prompt-conditioned instance-query generator transforms a single point prompt
into multiple specialized queries, enabling retrieval of all semantically
similar lesions across the 3D volume from a single exemplar. A hybrid
CNN-Transformer encoder injects CNN-derived boundary saliency into ViT
self-attention via spatial gating. A competitively optimized query decoder then
enables end-to-end, parallel, multi-instance prediction through inter-query
competition. On LiTS17 and KiTS21 dataset, MIQ-SAM3D achieved comparable levels
and exhibits strong robustness to prompts, providing a practical solution for
efficient annotation of clinically relevant multi-lesion cases.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly

Content-Style Balance loss. Our method improves content similarity across
varying style intensities, significantly broadening the content-style frontier.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, achieving superior
content-style trade-off with significantly lower Inverted Generational Distance

demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline using the task of rock detection
with poor visibility and suspended particulate matter, but the approach can be

integrates modified cube-map conversion and radius-based spherical camera
projection to enhance recognition and localization accuracy. Through
validations with two real-world case studies, the proposed approach achieves
F1-scores of 73% and 88% and localization errors of 0.620 and 0.428 meters,

Abstract: Faithful yet compact explanations for vision models remain a challenge, as
commonly used dense perturbation masks are often fragmented and overfitted,
needing careful post-processing. Here, we present a training-free explanation
method that replaces dense masks with smooth tunable contours. A star-convex
region is parameterized by a truncated Fourier series and optimized under an
extremal preserve/delete objective using the classifier gradients. The approach
guarantees a single, simply connected mask, cuts the number of free parameters
by orders of magnitude, and yields stable boundary updates without cleanup.
Restricting solutions to low-dimensional, smooth contours makes the method
robust to adversarial masking artifacts. On ImageNet classifiers, it matches
the extremal fidelity of dense masks while producing compact, interpretable
regions with improved run-to-run consistency. Explicit area control also
enables importance contour maps, yielding a transparent fidelity-area profiles.
Finally, we extend the approach to multi-contour and show how it can localize
multiple objects within the same framework. Across benchmarks, the method
achieves higher relevance mass and lower complexity than gradient and
perturbation based baselines, with especially strong gains on self-supervised
DINO models where it improves relevance mass by over 15% and maintains positive
faithfulness correlations.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{Wonder3D++}, a novel method for
efficiently generating high-fidelity textured meshes from single-view images.
Recent methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have shown the
potential to recover 3D geometry from 2D diffusion priors, but they typically
suffer from time-consuming per-shape optimization and inconsistent geometry. In
contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network
inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric
details. To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of
single-view reconstruction tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model
that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To
ensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain
attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and
modalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that
drives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only
about $3$ minute in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results,
robust generalization, and good efficiency compared to prior works. Code

Abstract: Recent hybrid video generation models combine autoregressive temporal
dynamics with diffusion-based spatial denoising, but their sequential,
iterative nature leads to error accumulation and long inference times. In this
work, we propose a distillation-based framework for efficient causal video
generation that enables high-quality synthesis with extremely limited denoising
steps. Our approach builds upon the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)
framework and proposes a novel Adversarial Self-Distillation (ASD) strategy,
which aligns the outputs of the student model's n-step denoising process with
its (n+1)-step version at the distribution level. This design provides smoother
supervision by bridging small intra-student gaps and more informative guidance
by combining teacher knowledge with locally consistent student behavior,
substantially improving training stability and generation quality in extremely
few-step scenarios (e.g., 1-2 steps). In addition, we present a First-Frame
Enhancement (FFE) strategy, which allocates more denoising steps to the initial
frames to mitigate error propagation while applying larger skipping steps to
later frames. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method
surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both one-step and two-step video
generation. Notably, our framework produces a single distilled model that
flexibly supports multiple inference-step settings, eliminating the need for
repeated re-distillation and enabling efficient, high-quality video synthesis.

evaluation in surgery, and the Surgical Plausibility Pyramid (SPP), a novel,
four-tiered framework tailored to assess model outputs from basic appearance to
complex surgical strategy. On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the
advanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from
laparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified
surgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results
reveal a distinct "plausibility gap": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual
Perceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP,
including Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility,
and Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative
evidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal
understanding in surgical AI. Our findings from SurgVeo and the SPP establish a
crucial foundation and roadmap for developing future models capable of
navigating the complexities of specialized, real-world healthcare domains.

Abstract: Off-road semantic segmentation suffers from thick, inconsistent boundaries,
sparse supervision for rare classes, and pervasive label noise. Designs that
fuse only at low resolution blur edges and propagate local errors, whereas
maintaining high-resolution pathways or repeating high-resolution fusions is
costly and fragile to noise. We introduce a resolutionaware token decoder that
balances global semantics, local consistency, and boundary fidelity under
imperfect supervision. Most computation occurs at a low-resolution bottleneck;
a gated cross-attention injects fine-scale detail, and only a sparse,
uncertainty-selected set of pixels is refined. The components are co-designed
and tightly integrated: global self-attention with lightweight dilated
depthwise refinement restores local coherence; a gated cross-attention
integrates fine-scale features from a standard high-resolution encoder stream
without amplifying noise; and a class-aware point refinement corrects residual
ambiguities with negligible overhead. During training, we add a boundary-band
consistency regularizer that encourages coherent predictions in a thin
neighborhood around annotated edges, with no inference-time cost. Overall, the
results indicate competitive performance and improved stability across
transitions.

Abstract: Robust perception at night remains challenging for thermal-infrared
detection: low contrast and weak high-frequency cues lead to duplicate,
overlapping boxes, missed small objects, and class confusion. Prior remedies
either translate TIR to RGB and hope pixel fidelity transfers to detection --
making performance fragile to color or structure artifacts -- or fuse RGB and
TIR at test time, which requires extra sensors, precise calibration, and higher
runtime cost. Both lines can help in favorable conditions, but do not directly
shape the thermal representation used by the detector. We keep mono-modality
inference and tackle the root causes during training. Specifically, we
introduce training-only objectives that sharpen instance-level decision
boundaries by pulling together features of the same class and pushing apart
those of different classes -- suppressing duplicate and confusing detections --
and that inject cross-modal semantic priors by aligning the student's
multi-level pyramid features with an RGB-trained teacher, thereby strengthening
texture-poor thermal features without visible input at test time. In
experiments, our method outperformed prior approaches and achieved
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for semantic communication, delivering significant performance gains over
conventional separate coding schemes. However, existing JSCC frameworks remain
vulnerable to physical-layer adversarial threats, such as pilot spoofing and
subcarrier jamming, compromising semantic fidelity. In this paper, we propose
SecDiff, a plug-and-play, diffusion-aided decoding framework that significantly
enhances the security and robustness of deep JSCC under adversarial wireless
environments. Different from prior diffusion-guided JSCC methods that suffer
from high inference latency, SecDiff employs pseudoinverse-guided sampling and
adaptive guidance weighting, enabling flexible step-size control and efficient
semantic reconstruction. To counter jamming attacks, we introduce a power-based
subcarrier masking strategy and recast recovery as a masked inpainting problem,
solved via diffusion guidance. For pilot spoofing, we formulate channel
estimation as a blind inverse problem and develop an expectation-minimization
(EM)-driven reconstruction algorithm, guided jointly by reconstruction loss and
a channel operator. Notably, our method alternates between pilot recovery and
channel estimation, enabling joint refinement of both variables throughout the
diffusion process. Extensive experiments over orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) channels under adversarial conditions show that SecDiff
outperforms existing secure and generative JSCC baselines by achieving a
favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational cost. This
balance makes SecDiff a promising step toward practical, low-latency, and
attack-resilient semantic communications.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer
vision, yet it remains challenging due to partial observability, occlusions,
and object symmetries, which inevitably lead to pose ambiguity and multiple
hypotheses consistent with the same observation. While deterministic deep
networks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they
are often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the
underlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
probabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for
estimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a
single deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution
with a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in
ambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our
sample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation
tasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or
guiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion, two fundamental 3D perception
tasks, has made significant strides in recent years. However, most methods
treat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or
excluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs
limit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability
and robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative
treatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their
respective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given
consecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and
imaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames
are transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to
impose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,
enabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the
joint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each
translation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric
relationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth
robustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework
incorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple
public datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly
under challenging conditions. Our source code will be publicly available at
mias.group/DiMoDE upon publication.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) faces persistent challenges in balancing
reconstruction fidelity with cross-scenario generalization. While existing
methods predominantly focus on deterministic pixel-level mappings between
paired low/normal-light images, they often neglect the continuous physical
process of luminance transitions in real-world environments, leading to
performance drop when normal-light references are unavailable. Inspired by
empirical analysis of natural luminance dynamics revealing power-law
distributed intensity transitions, this paper introduces Luminance-Aware
Statistical Quantification (LASQ), a novel framework that reformulates LLIE as
a statistical sampling process over hierarchical luminance distributions. Our
LASQ re-conceptualizes luminance transition as a power-law distribution in
intensity coordinate space that can be approximated by stratified power
functions, therefore, replacing deterministic mappings with probabilistic
sampling over continuous luminance layers. A diffusion forward process is
designed to autonomously discover optimal transition paths between luminance
layers, achieving unsupervised distribution emulation without normal-light
references. In this way, it considerably improves the performance in practical
situations, enabling more adaptable and versatile light restoration. This
framework is also readily applicable to cases with normal-light references,
where it achieves superior performance on domain-specific datasets alongside
better generalization-ability across non-reference datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a system that covers the complete workflow for
achieving controlled authoring and editing of textures that present distinctive
local characteristics. These include various effects that change the surface
appearance of materials, such as stains, tears, holes, abrasions,
discoloration, and more. Such alterations are ubiquitous in nature, and
including them in the synthesis process is crucial for generating realistic
textures. We introduce a novel approach for creating textures with such
blemishes, adopting a learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled
examples. Our approach does not require manual annotations by the user;
instead, it detects the appearance-altering features through unsupervised
anomaly detection. The various textural features are then automatically
clustered into semantically coherent groups, which are used to guide the
conditional generation of images. Our pipeline as a whole goes from a small
image collection to a versatile generative model that enables the user to
interactively create and paint features on textures of arbitrary size. Notably,
the algorithms we introduce for diffusion-based editing and infinite stationary
texture generation are generic and should prove useful in other contexts as
well. Project page: https://reality.tf.fau.de/pub/ardelean2025examplebased.html

Abstract: Current text conditioned image generation methods output realistic looking
images, but they fail to capture specific styles. Simply finetuning them on the
target style datasets still struggles to grasp the style features. In this
work, we present a novel contrastive learning framework to improve the
stylization capability of large text-to-image diffusion models. Motivated by
the astonishing advance in image generation models that makes synthetic data an
intrinsic part of model training in various computer vision tasks, we exploit
synthetic image generation in our approach. Usually, the generated synthetic
data is dependent on the task, and most of the time it is used to enlarge the
available real training dataset. With NSYNC, alternatively, we focus on
generating negative synthetic sets to be used in a novel contrastive training
scheme along with real positive images. In our proposed training setup, we
forward negative data along with positive data and obtain negative and positive
gradients, respectively. We then refine the positive gradient by subtracting
its projection onto the negative gradient to get the orthogonal component,
based on which the parameters are updated. This orthogonal component eliminates
the trivial attributes that are present in both positive and negative data and
directs the model towards capturing a more unique style. Experiments on various
styles of painters and illustrators show that our approach improves the
performance over the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Occluded pedestrian re-identification (ReID) in base station environments is
a critical task in computer vision, particularly for surveillance and security
applications. This task faces numerous challenges, as occlusions often obscure
key body features, increasing the complexity of identification. Traditional
ResNet-based ReID algorithms often fail to address occlusions effectively,
necessitating new ReID methods. We propose the PCD-ReID (Pedestrian Component
Discrepancy) algorithm to address these issues. The contributions of this work
are as follows: To tackle the occlusion problem, we design a Transformer-based
PCD network capable of extracting shared component features, such as helmets
and uniforms. To mitigate overfitting on public datasets, we collected new
real-world patrol surveillance images for model training, covering six months,
10,000 individuals, and over 50,000 images. Comparative experiments with
existing ReID algorithms demonstrate that our model achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 79.0% and a Rank-1 accuracy of 82.7%, marking a 15.9% Rank-1
improvement over ResNet50-based methods. Experimental evaluations indicate that
PCD-ReID effectively achieves occlusion-aware ReID performance for personnel in
tower inspection scenarios, highlighting its potential for practical deployment
in surveillance and security applications.

Abstract: AI tools can greatly enhance the analysis of organoid microscopy images, from
detection and segmentation to feature extraction and classification. However,
their limited accessibility to biologists without programming experience
remains a major barrier, resulting in labor-intensive and largely manual
workflows. Although a few AI models for organoid analysis have been developed,
most existing tools remain narrowly focused on specific tasks. In this work, we
introduce the Napari Organoid Analyzer (NOA), a general purpose graphical user
interface to simplify AI-based organoid analysis. NOA integrates modules for
detection, segmentation, tracking, feature extraction, custom feature
annotation and ML-based feature prediction. It interfaces multiple
state-of-the-art algorithms and is implemented as an open-source napari plugin
for maximal flexibility and extensibility. We demonstrate the versatility of
NOA through three case studies, involving the quantification of morphological
changes during organoid differentiation, assessment of phototoxicity effects,
and prediction of organoid viability and differentiation state. Together, these
examples illustrate how NOA enables comprehensive, AI-driven organoid image
analysis within an accessible and extensible framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are emerging as powerful tools for
learning generalizable visuomotor control policies. However, current VLAs are
mostly trained on large-scale image-text-action data and remain limited in two
key ways: (i) they struggle with pixel-level scene understanding, and (ii) they
rely heavily on textual prompts, which reduces their flexibility in real-world
settings. To address these challenges, we introduce PixelVLA, the first VLA
model designed to support both pixel-level reasoning and multimodal prompting
with text and visual inputs. Our approach is built on a new visuomotor
instruction tuning framework that integrates a multiscale pixel-aware encoder
with a visual prompting encoder. To train PixelVLA effectively, we further
propose a two-stage automated annotation pipeline that generates Pixel-160K, a
large-scale dataset with pixel-level annotations derived from existing robot
data. Experiments on three standard VLA benchmarks and two VLA model variants
show that PixelVLA improves manipulation success rates by 10.1%-17.8% over
OpenVLA, while requiring only 1.5% of its pretraining cost. These results
demonstrate that PixelVLA can be integrated into existing VLAs to enable more
accurate, efficient, and versatile robot control in complex environments. The
dataset and code will be released as open source.

Abstract: Compared to traditional methods, Deep Learning (DL) becomes a key technology
for computer vision tasks. Synthetic data generation is an interesting use case
for DL, especially in the field of medical imaging such as Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI). The need for this task since the original MRI data is limited.
The generation of realistic medical images is completely difficult and
challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are useful for creating
synthetic medical images. In this paper, we propose a DL based methodology for
creating synthetic MRI data using the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Network (DC-GAN) to address the problem of limited data. We also employ a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the brain tumor using
synthetic data and real MRI data. CNN is used to evaluate the quality and
utility of the synthetic images. The classification result demonstrates
comparable performance on real and synthetic images, which validates the
effectiveness of GAN-generated images for downstream tasks.

Abstract: The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal
large model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the
dichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous
tokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple
independently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers
from complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead.
Conversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by
quantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information
loss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the
binary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of
light, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).
We treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from
quantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number
assigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its
complexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete
tokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous
tokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative
Primitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate
information space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample
complexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on
reconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior
performance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result
within a concise and scalable MLLM.

Abstract: Accurate tumor size measurement is a cornerstone of evaluating cancer
treatment response. The most widely adopted standard for this purpose is the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, which relies on
measuring the longest tumor diameter in a single plane. However, volumetric
measurements have been shown to provide a more reliable assessment of treatment
effect. Their clinical adoption has been limited, though, due to the
labor-intensive nature of manual volumetric annotation. In this paper, we
present Lite ENSAM, a lightweight adaptation of the ENSAM architecture designed
for efficient volumetric tumor segmentation from CT scans annotated with RECIST
annotations. Lite ENSAM was submitted to the MICCAI FLARE 2025 Task 1:
Pan-cancer Segmentation in CT Scans, Subtask 2, where it achieved a Dice

Abstract: Progress in anatomical 3D shape classification is limited by the complexity
of mesh data and the lack of standardized benchmarks, highlighting the need for
robust learning methods and reproducible evaluation. We introduce two key steps
toward clinically and benchmark-ready anatomical shape classification via
self-supervised graph autoencoding. We propose Precomputed Structural Pooling
(PSPooling), a non-learnable mesh pooling operator designed for efficient and
structure-preserving graph coarsening in 3D anatomical shape analysis.
PSPooling precomputes node correspondence sets based on geometric proximity,
enabling parallelizable and reversible pooling and unpooling operations with
guaranteed support structure. This design avoids the sparsity and
reconstruction issues of selection-based methods and the sequential overhead of
edge contraction approaches, making it particularly suitable for
high-resolution medical meshes. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we integrate
PSPooling into a self-supervised graph autoencoder that learns anatomy-aware
representations from unlabeled surface meshes. We evaluate the downstream
benefits on MedShapeNet19, a new curated benchmark dataset we derive from
MedShapeNet, consisting of 19 anatomical classes with standardized training,
validation, and test splits. Experiments show that PSPooling significantly
improves reconstruction fidelity and classification accuracy in low-label
regimes, establishing a strong baseline for medical 3D shape learning. We hope
that MedShapeNet19 will serve as a widely adopted benchmark for anatomical
shape classification and further research in medical 3D shape analysis. Access

Abstract: In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is
a long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as
videos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on
rank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work
introduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that
re-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a
Vision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content
evidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the
model to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic
content. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the
challenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce
the S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image
grid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video
candidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it
dramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an
ensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
CombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the
framework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals
alongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%
(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive
gains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We
present ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning
modern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers. Code and resources

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been incorporated into diffusion
models, e.g., tasks such as text-to-image. However, directly applying existing
RL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the
objective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it
places greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,
through extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an
effective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,
instead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been
optimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,
our strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly
distant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented
using MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images
initially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is
adaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic
process is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts
based on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is
plug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration
models, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed RL framework.

Abstract: Relighting is a crucial task with both practical demand and artistic value,
and recent diffusion models have shown strong potential by enabling rich and
controllable lighting effects. However, as they are typically optimized in
semantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness
in visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed
highlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with
UniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings
RGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the
model with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly
align lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical
plausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for
supervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising
computationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency
learning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training
regimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a
structured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination
attributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled
attribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large
vision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of
relighting precision across individual dimensions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with
significantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for
both image and video relighting. Code is available at

Abstract: Compared to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) not
only maintains the structural features of tissue samples, but also provides
high-resolution protein localization, which is essential for aiding in
pathology diagnosis. Despite its diagnostic value, IHC remains a costly and
labor-intensive technique. Its limited scalability and constraints in
multiplexing further hinder widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited
settings. Consequently, researchers are increasingly exploring computational
stain translation techniques to synthesize IHC-equivalent images from
H&E-stained slides, aiming to extract protein-level information more
efficiently and cost-effectively. However, most existing stain translation
techniques rely on a linearly weighted summation of multiple loss terms within
a single objective function, strategy that often overlooks the interdepedence
among these components-resulting in suboptimal image quality and an inability
to simultaneously preserve structural authenticity and color fidelity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel network architecture that follows a
progressive structure, incorporating color and cell border generation logic,
which enables each visual aspect to be optimized in a stage-wise and decoupled
manner. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, we
build upon the Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP) framework as our baseline. We
introduce additional loss functions based on 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
chromogen concentration and image gradient, enhancing color fidelity and cell
boundary clarity in the generated IHC images. By reconstructing the generation
pipeline using our structure-color-cell boundary progressive mechanism,
experiments on HER2 and ER datasets demonstrated that the model significantly
improved visual quality and achieved finer structural details.

Abstract: Under-display ToF imaging aims to achieve accurate depth sensing through a
ToF camera placed beneath a screen panel. However, transparent OLED (TOLED)
layers introduce severe degradations-such as signal attenuation, multi-path
interference (MPI), and temporal noise-that significantly compromise depth
quality. To alleviate this drawback, we propose Learnable Fractional
Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics (LFRD2), a hybrid framework that combines the
expressive power of neural networks with the interpretability of physical
modeling. Specifically, we implement a time-fractional reaction-diffusion
module that enables iterative depth refinement with dynamically generated
differential orders, capturing long-term dependencies. In addition, we
introduce an efficient continuous convolution operator via coefficient
prediction and repeated differentiation to further improve restoration quality.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wudiqx106/LFRD2.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously vulnerable to imperceptible
perturbations. Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),
which evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of
deterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness
(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that
predictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely
regarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for
improving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.
Among the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i
non-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT
baselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to
compare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the
first benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by
different robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common
AT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,
including clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and
generalization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR
performance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by
PRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training
methods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse
hyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield
lower GE and higher clean accuracy. A leaderboard comprising 222 trained models
across 7 datasets and 10 model architectures is publicly available at

Abstract: This research builds on work in anticipatory human-machine interaction, a
subfield of human-machine interaction where machines can facilitate
advantageous interactions by anticipating a user's future state. The aim of
this research is to further a machine's understanding of user knowledge, skill,
and behavior in pursuit of implicit coordination. A task explorer pipeline was
developed that uses clustering techniques, paired with factor analysis and
string edit distance, to automatically identify key global and local strategies
that are used to complete tasks. Global strategies identify generalized sets of
actions used to complete tasks, while local strategies identify sequences that
used those sets of actions in a similar composition. Additionally, meaningful
subtasks of various lengths are identified within the tasks. The task explorer
pipeline was able to automatically identify key strategies used to complete
tasks and encode user runs with hierarchical subtask structures. In addition, a
Task Explorer application was developed to easily review pipeline results. The
task explorer pipeline can be easily modified to any action-based time-series
data and the identified strategies and subtasks help to inform humans and
machines on user knowledge, skill, and behavior.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
necessitating accurate and efficient automated detection systems. While recent
transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR have shown promise in object detection
tasks, their application to medical imaging, particularly pneumonia detection
in chest X-rays, remains underexplored. This paper presents CGF-DETR, an
enhanced real-time detection transformer specifically designed for pneumonia
detection. We introduce XFABlock in the backbone to improve multi-scale feature
extraction through convolutional attention mechanisms integrated with CSP
architecture. To achieve efficient feature aggregation, we propose SPGA module
that replaces standard multi-head attention with dynamic gating mechanisms and
single-head self-attention. Additionally, GCFC3 is designed for the neck to
enhance feature representation through multi-path convolution fusion while
maintaining real-time performance via structural re-parameterization. Extensive
experiments on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset demonstrate that CGF-DETR
achieves 82.2% mAP@0.5, outperforming the baseline RT-DETR-l by 3.7% while
maintaining comparable inference speed at 48.1 FPS. Our ablation studies
confirm that each proposed module contributes meaningfully to the overall
performance improvement, with the complete model achieving 50.4% mAP@[0.5:0.95]

Abstract: Visual grounding in 3D is the key for embodied agents to localize
language-referred objects in open-world environments. However, existing
benchmarks are limited to indoor focus, single-platform constraints, and small
scale. We introduce 3EED, a multi-platform, multi-modal 3D grounding benchmark
featuring RGB and LiDAR data from vehicle, drone, and quadruped platforms. We
provide over 128,000 objects and 22,000 validated referring expressions across
diverse outdoor scenes -- 10x larger than existing datasets. We develop a
scalable annotation pipeline combining vision-language model prompting with
human verification to ensure high-quality spatial grounding. To support
cross-platform learning, we propose platform-aware normalization and
cross-modal alignment techniques, and establish benchmark protocols for
in-domain and cross-platform evaluations. Our findings reveal significant
performance gaps, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of
generalizable 3D grounding. The 3EED dataset and benchmark toolkit are released
to advance future research in language-driven 3D embodied perception.

Abstract: 2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose
estimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and
attention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the
spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and
errors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous
studies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by
constraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the
global spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this
problem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid
feature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain.
Specifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a
Transformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The
HGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group
to enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover
the latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global
temporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency
domain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and
maintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the
3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark
datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed
HGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional
accuracy and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Although transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, their quadratic attention mechanisms introduce significant
computational overhead when processing long-sequence data. In this paper, we
present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles
large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even
temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs
linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single
versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized
variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal
temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or
multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive
and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks,
including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D
occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion
prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm
naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous
driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope
UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models
in autonomous driving. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a robust framework for
enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. Recent advances
in RAG have investigated graph based retrieval for intricate reasoning;
however, the influence of prompt design on enhancing the retrieval and
reasoning process is still considerably under-examined. In this paper, we
present a prompt-driven GraphRAG framework that underscores the significance of
prompt formulation in facilitating entity extraction, fact selection, and
passage reranking for multi-hop question answering. Our approach creates a
symbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual
relationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during
online retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also
use entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to
support efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built.
Our system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA,
with F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%,
respectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of
improving retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research lays the
groundwork for more efficient and comprehensible multi-hop question-answering
systems, highlighting the importance of prompt-aware graph reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to connect visual patterns with the processes that form them
represents one of the deepest forms of visual understanding. Textures of clouds
and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and
landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We
present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and
visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the
models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different
models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry,
biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way
to explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and
the mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that
autonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use
SciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual
patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different
patterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer
and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image
of a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the
mechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated
image that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that
vision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system
beyond a visual pattern. The dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3,
which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for
problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in
chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced
capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current
thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as
localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic,
and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks,
each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in
chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from
leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use
augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and
strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally,
we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.

challenging visualization tasks that cover a wide range of topics, such as

seven high-level visualization tasks and encompasses 48 distinct chart types.
Crucially, it is the first to systematically evaluate both single-turn
generation and multi-turn refinement across a diverse spectrum of task
complexities. Our comprehensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs on PlotCraft
reveals obvious performance deficiencies in handling sophisticated
visualization tasks. To bridge this performance gap, we develope SynthVis-30K,
a large-scale, high-quality dataset of complex visualization code synthesized
via a collaborative agent framework. Building upon this dataset, we develope
PlotCraftor, a novel code generation model that achieves strong capabilities in
complex data visualization with a remarkably small size. Across VisEval,
PandasPlotBench, and our proposed PlotCraft, PlotCraftor shows performance
comparable to that of leading proprietary approaches. Especially, on hard task,
Our model achieves over 50% performance improvement. We will release the

Abstract: Personality recognition from text is typically cast as hard-label
classification, which obscures the graded, prototype-like nature of human
personality judgments. We present ProtoMBTI, a cognitively aligned framework
for MBTI inference that operationalizes prototype theory within an LLM-based
pipeline. First, we construct a balanced, quality-controlled corpus via
LLM-guided multi-dimensional augmentation (semantic, linguistic, sentiment).
Next, we LoRA-fine-tune a lightweight (<=2B) encoder to learn discriminative
embeddings and to standardize a bank of personality prototypes. At inference,
we retrieve top-k prototypes for a query post and perform a
retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle: the model aggregates prototype evidence
via prompt-based voting, revises when inconsistencies arise, and, upon correct
prediction, retains the sample to continually enrich the prototype library.
Across Kaggle and Pandora benchmarks, ProtoMBTI improves over baselines on both
the four MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, and exhibits robust
cross-dataset generalization. Our results indicate that aligning the inference
process with psychological prototype reasoning yields gains in accuracy,
interpretability, and transfer for text-based personality modeling.

natural-language generation. This work offers a principled approach to
optimizing LLM training, advancing both model performance and theoretical
understanding of the target-token selection strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human users in

these simulations enable scalable training and evaluation of AI agents,
off-the-shelf LLMs often drift from their assigned personas, contradict earlier
statements, or abandon role-appropriate behavior. We introduce a unified
framework for evaluating and improving persona consistency in LLM-generated
dialogue. We define three automatic metrics: prompt-to-line consistency,
line-to-line consistency, and Q&A consistency, that capture different types of
persona drift and validate each against human annotations. Using these metrics
as reward signals, we apply multi-turn reinforcement learning to fine-tune LLMs
for three user roles: a patient, a student, and a social chat partner. Our
method reduces inconsistency by over 55%, resulting in more coherent and
faithful simulated users.

Abstract: Traditional cybersecurity tabletop exercises (TTXs) provide valuable training
but are often scripted, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale. We
introduce AgentBnB, a browser-based re-imagining of the Backdoors & Breaches
game that integrates large language model teammates with a Bloom-aligned,
retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). The system expands a curated corpus into
factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive snippets, delivering
on-demand, cognitively targeted hints. Prompt-engineered agents employ a
scaffolding ladder that gradually fades as learner confidence grows. In a
solo-player pilot with four graduate students, participants reported greater
intention to use the agent-based version compared to the physical card deck and
viewed it as more scalable, though a ceiling effect emerged on a simple
knowledge quiz. Despite limitations of small sample size, single-player focus,
and narrow corpus, these early findings suggest that large language model
augmented TTXs can provide lightweight, repeatable practice without the
logistical burden of traditional exercises. Planned extensions include
multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with
larger cohorts.

Abstract: Identifying/retrieving relevant statutes and prior cases/precedents for a
given legal situation are common tasks exercised by law practitioners.
Researchers to date have addressed the two tasks independently, thus developing
completely different datasets and models for each task; however, both retrieval
tasks are inherently related, e.g., similar cases tend to cite similar statutes
(due to similar factual situation). In this paper, we address this gap. We
propose IL-PCR (Indian Legal corpus for Prior Case and Statute Retrieval),
which is a unique corpus that provides a common testbed for developing models
for both the tasks (Statute Retrieval and Precedent Retrieval) that can exploit
the dependence between the two. We experiment extensively with several baseline
models on the tasks, including lexical models, semantic models and ensemble
based on GNNs. Further, to exploit the dependence between the two tasks, we
develop an LLM-based re-ranking approach that gives the best performance.

Abstract: Sign language translation remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of

translation for sign languages. We propose POSESTITCH-SLT, a novel pre-training
scheme that is inspired by linguistic-templates-based sentence generation
technique. With translation comparison on two sign language datasets, How2Sign
and iSign, we show that a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture
outperforms the prior art when considering template-generated sentence pairs in
training. We achieve BLEU-4 score improvements from 1.97 to 4.56 on How2Sign
and from 0.55 to 3.43 on iSign, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods for

Abstract: We propose Factorization Memory, an efficient recurrent neural network (RNN)
architecture that achieves performance comparable to Transformer models on
short-context language modeling tasks while also demonstrating superior
generalization in long-context scenarios. Our model builds upon Mamba-2,
enabling Factorization Memory to exploit parallel computations during training
while preserving constant computational and memory complexity during inference.
To further optimize model efficiency and representational capacity, we develop
a sparse formulation of Factorization Memory that updates only a subset of
recurrent states at each step while preserving the strong performance of its
dense counterpart. To our knowledge, this represents the first RNN architecture
that successfully combines sparse memory activation with competitive
performance across both short and long-context settings. This work provides a
systematic empirical analysis of Factorization Memory in comparison to
Transformer and Mamba-2 architectures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We formalize a structural property of the causal (autoregressive) language
modeling (CLM) objective: reversal invariance. Formally, the next-token
prediction loss assigns identical likelihood to a corpus and its reversal,
implying that standard CLM pretraining is direction-blind. This symmetry
explains why models trained on reversed text can achieve comparable performance
to those trained on forward text, despite the inherently time-asymmetric nature
of human language and reasoning. We argue that this invariance represents a
limitation of current pretraining objectives rather than a benign artifact. If
natural language encodes directional dependencies - phonological,
morphological, or causal - a symmetric objective may fail to capture them. We
therefore propose viewing pretraining through the lens of temporal asymmetry,
motivating future work on loss functions and architectures that explicitly
model the arrow of language while retaining standard language modeling
capacity.

Abstract: This paper introduces LingGym, a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs' capacity
for meta-linguistic reasoning using Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) and
grammatical descriptions extracted from 18 typologically diverse reference
grammars. Unlike previous work that focuses on specific downstream tasks, we
assess whether LLMs can generalize linguistic inference across low-resource
languages and structures not seen during training. We present a controlled
evaluation task: Word-Gloss Inference, in which the model must infer a missing
word and gloss from context using varying levels of linguistic information
(e.g., glosses, grammatical explanations, translations). Our results show that
incorporating structured linguistic cues leads to consistent improvements in
reasoning performance across all models. This work highlights both the promise
and current limitations of using LLMs for typologically informed linguistic
analysis and low-resource language documentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In Socratic debugging, instructors guide students towards identifying and
fixing a bug on their own, instead of providing the bug fix directly. Most
novice programmer bugs are caused by programming misconceptions, namely false
beliefs about a programming concept. In this context, Socratic debugging can be
formulated as a guided Reasoning Trajectory (RT) leading to a statement about
the program behavior that contradicts the bug-causing misconception. Upon
reaching this statement, the ensuing cognitive dissonance leads the student to
first identify and then update their false belief. In this paper, we introduce
the task of reasoning trajectory generation, together with a dataset of
debugging problems manually annotated with RTs. We then describe LLM-based
solutions for generating RTs and Socratic conversations that are anchored on
them. A large-scale LLM-as-judge evaluation shows that frontier models can
generate up to 91% correct reasoning trajectories and 98.7% valid conversation
turns.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While AI-generated text (AIGT) detectors achieve over 90\% accuracy on direct
LLM outputs, they fail catastrophically against iteratively-paraphrased
content. We investigate why iteratively-paraphrased text -- itself AI-generated
-- evades detection systems designed for AIGT identification. Through intrinsic
mechanism analysis, we reveal that iterative paraphrasing creates an
intermediate laundering region characterized by semantic displacement with
preserved generation patterns, which brings up two attack categories:
paraphrasing human-authored text (authorship obfuscation) and paraphrasing
LLM-generated text (plagiarism evasion). To address these vulnerabilities, we
introduce PADBen, the first benchmark systematically evaluating detector
robustness against both paraphrase attack scenarios. PADBen comprises a
five-type text taxonomy capturing the full trajectory from original content to
deeply laundered text, and five progressive detection tasks across
sentence-pair and single-sentence challenges. We evaluate 11 state-of-the-art
detectors, revealing critical asymmetry: detectors successfully identify the
plagiarism evasion problem but fail for the case of authorship obfuscation. Our
findings demonstrate that current detection approaches cannot effectively
handle the intermediate laundering region, necessitating fundamental advances
in detection architectures beyond existing semantic and stylistic
discrimination methods. For detailed code implementation, please see

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing promise in medical applications,
but their ability to detect and correct errors in clinical texts -- a
prerequisite for safe deployment -- remains under-evaluated, particularly
beyond English. We introduce MedRECT, a cross-lingual benchmark
(Japanese/English) that formulates medical error handling as three subtasks:
error detection, error localization (sentence extraction), and error
correction. MedRECT is built with a scalable, automated pipeline from the
Japanese Medical Licensing Examinations (JMLE) and a curated English
counterpart, yielding MedRECT-ja (663 texts) and MedRECT-en (458 texts) with
comparable error/no-error balance. We evaluate 9 contemporary LLMs spanning
proprietary, open-weight, and reasoning families. Key findings: (i) reasoning
models substantially outperform standard architectures, with up to 13.5%
relative improvement in error detection and 51.0% in sentence extraction; (ii)
cross-lingual evaluation reveals 5-10% performance gaps from English to
Japanese, with smaller disparities for reasoning models; (iii) targeted LoRA
fine-tuning yields asymmetric improvements in error correction performance
(Japanese: +0.078, English: +0.168) while preserving reasoning capabilities;
and (iv) our fine-tuned model exceeds human expert performance on structured
medical error correction tasks. To our knowledge, MedRECT is the first
comprehensive cross-lingual benchmark for medical error correction, providing a
reproducible framework and resources for developing safer medical LLMs across
languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, these models exhibit a
critical limitation in output diversity, often generating highly similar
content across multiple attempts. This limitation significantly affects tasks
requiring diverse outputs, from creative writing to reasoning. Existing
solutions, like temperature scaling, enhance diversity by modifying probability
distributions but compromise output quality. We propose Guide-to-Generation
(G2), a training-free plug-and-play method that enhances output diversity while
preserving generation quality. G2 employs a base generator alongside dual
Guides, which guide the generation process through decoding-based interventions
to encourage more diverse outputs conditioned on the original query.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that G2 effectively improves output
diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between diversity and quality.

Abstract: Ongoing breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping search
and recommendation platforms at their core. While this shift unlocks powerful
new scientometric tools, it also exposes critical fairness and bias issues that
could erode the integrity of the information ecosystem. Additionally, as LLMs
become more integrated into web-based searches for scholarly tools, their
ability to generate summarized research work based on memorized data introduces
new dimensions to these challenges. The extent of memorization in LLMs can
impact the accuracy and fairness of the co-authorship networks they produce,
potentially reflecting and amplifying existing biases within the scientific
community and across different regions. This study critically examines the
impact of LLM memorization on the co-authorship networks. To this end, we
assess memorization effects across three prominent models, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4
Scout, and Mixtral 8x7B, analyzing how memorization-driven outputs vary across
academic disciplines and world regions. While our global analysis reveals a
consistent bias favoring highly cited researchers, this pattern is not
uniformly observed. Certain disciplines, such as Clinical Medicine, and
regions, including parts of Africa, show more balanced representation, pointing
to areas where LLM training data may reflect greater equity. These findings
underscore both the risks and opportunities in deploying LLMs for scholarly
discovery.

Abstract: The linguistic diversity of India poses significant machine translation
challenges, especially for underrepresented tribal languages like Bhili, which
lack high-quality linguistic resources. This paper addresses the gap by
introducing Bhili-Hindi-English Parallel Corpus (BHEPC), the first and largest
parallel corpus worldwide comprising 110,000 meticulously curated sentences
across Bhili, Hindi, and English. The corpus was created with the assistance of
expert human translators. BHEPC spans critical domains such as education,
administration, and news, establishing a valuable benchmark for research in low
resource machine translation. To establish a comprehensive Bhili Machine
Translation benchmark, we evaluated a wide range of proprietary and open-source
Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs) on bidirectional translation tasks
between English/Hindi and Bhili. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the
fine-tuned NLLB-200 distilled 600M variant model outperforms others,
highlighting the potential of multilingual models in low resource scenarios.
Furthermore, we investigated the generative translation capabilities of
multilingual LLMs on BHEPC using in-context learning, assessing performance
under cross-domain generalization and quantifying distributional divergence.
This work bridges a critical resource gap and promotes inclusive natural
language processing technologies for low-resource and marginalized languages
globally.

Abstract: Recent work in Differential Privacy with Natural Language Processing (DP NLP)
has proposed numerous promising techniques in the form of text rewriting
mechanisms. In the evaluation of these mechanisms, an often-ignored aspect is
that of dataset size, or rather, the effect of dataset size on a mechanism's
efficacy for utility and privacy preservation. In this work, we are the first
to introduce this factor in the evaluation of DP text privatization, where we
design utility and privacy tests on large-scale datasets with dynamic split
sizes. We run these tests on datasets of varying size with up to one million
texts, and we focus on quantifying the effect of increasing dataset size on the
privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings reveal that dataset size plays an
integral part in evaluating DP text rewriting mechanisms; additionally, these
findings call for more rigorous evaluation procedures in DP NLP, as well as
shed light on the future of DP NLP in practice and at scale.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), constrained by limited context windows, often
face significant performance degradation when reasoning over long contexts. To
address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves and reasons over
chunks but frequently sacrifices logical coherence due to its reliance on
similarity-based rankings. Similarly, divide-and-conquer frameworks (DCF) split
documents into small chunks for independent reasoning and aggregation. While
effective for local reasoning, DCF struggles to capture long-range dependencies
and risks inducing conflicts by processing chunks in isolation. To overcome
these limitations, we propose ToM, a novel Tree-oriented MapReduce framework
for long-context reasoning. ToM leverages the inherent hierarchical structure
of long documents (e.g., main headings and subheadings) by constructing a
DocTree through hierarchical semantic parsing and performing bottom-up
aggregation. Using a Tree MapReduce approach, ToM enables recursive reasoning:
in the Map step, rationales are generated at child nodes; in the Reduce step,
these rationales are aggregated across sibling nodes to resolve conflicts or
reach consensus at parent nodes. Experimental results on 70B+ LLMs show that
ToM significantly outperforms existing divide-and-conquer frameworks and
retrieval-augmented generation methods, achieving better logical coherence and
long-context reasoning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation has shown remarkable results to address Large
Language Models' hallucinations, which usually uses a large external corpus to
supplement knowledge to LLMs. However, with the development of LLMs, the
internal knowledge of LLMs has expanded significantly, thus causing significant
knowledge redundancy between the external corpus and LLMs. On the one hand, the
indexing cost of dense retrieval is highly related to the corpus size and thus
significant redundant knowledge intensifies the dense retrieval's workload. On
the other hand, the redundant knowledge in the external corpus is not helpful
to LLMs and our exploratory analysis shows that it instead hurts the RAG
performance on those questions which the LLM can answer by itself. To address
these issues, we propose Zero-RAG to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we
first propose the Mastery-Score metric to identify redundant knowledge in the
RAG corpus to prune it. After pruning, answers to "mastered" questions rely
primarily on internal knowledge of the LLM. To better harness the internal
capacity, we propose Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning to avoid the
irrelevant documents' distraction and thus further improve the LLM's
utilization of internal knowledge with pruned corpus. Experimental results show
that Zero-RAG prunes the Wikipedia corpus by 30\% and accelerates the retrieval
stage by 22\%, without compromising RAG's performance.

Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly being explored to support healthcare

Large-scale conversational models typically rely on internet connectivity and
cloud infrastructure, which may not be accessible in rural areas. In this
study, we fine-tuned DialoGPT, a lightweight generative dialogue model that can
operate offline, on a synthetically constructed dataset of doctor-patient
interactions covering ten common diseases prevalent in rural Nepal, including
common cold, seasonal fever, diarrhea, typhoid fever, gastritis, food
poisoning, malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Despite being
trained on a limited, domain-specific dataset, the fine-tuned model produced
coherent, contextually relevant, and medically appropriate responses,
demonstrating an understanding of symptoms, disease context, and empathetic
communication. These results highlight the adaptability of compact,
offline-capable dialogue models and the effectiveness of targeted datasets for
domain adaptation in low-resource healthcare environments, offering promising
directions for future rural medical conversational AI.

Abstract: Gender bias in language models has gained increasing attention in the field
of natural language processing. Encoder-based transformer models, which have
achieved state-of-the-art performance in various language tasks, have been
shown to exhibit strong gender biases inherited from their training data. This
paper investigates gender bias in contextualized word embeddings, a crucial
component of transformer-based models. We focus on prominent architectures such
as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT to examine their vulnerability to
gender bias. To quantify the degree of bias, we introduce a novel metric,
MALoR, which assesses bias based on model probabilities for filling masked
tokens. We further propose a mitigation approach involving continued
pre-training on a gender-balanced dataset generated via Counterfactual Data
Augmentation. Our experiments reveal significant reductions in gender bias
scores across different pronoun pairs. For instance, in BERT-base, bias scores
for "he-she" dropped from 1.27 to 0.08, and "his-her" from 2.51 to 0.36
following our mitigation approach. We also observed similar improvements across
other models, with "male-female" bias decreasing from 1.82 to 0.10 in
BERT-large. Our approach effectively reduces gender bias without compromising
model performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are often bottlenecked by the high cost of
output tokens. We show that a significant portion of these tokens are useless
self-repetitions - what we call "word salad" - that exhaust the decoding budget
without adding value. Interestingly, we observe that LRMs are self-aware when
trapped in these loops: the hidden states of <\n\n> tokens trailing each
reasoning chunk exhibit patterns that allow us to detect word salad behavior
on-the-fly via a single-layer linear classifier. Once detected, a simple chop
appended by a straightforward regeneration prompt yields substantial length
savings with minimal quality loss. Our work offers WordSaladChopper (WSC) - a
lightweight, turnkey component for LRM that is minimally invasive to its
reasoning trajectory by only removing semantically redundant tokens. Given its
low overhead, strong savings, and the lack of semantic value of word salad
tokens, we believe it is not too far-fetched to argue that WSC - or a similar
component - is a must-have for all LRM applications with user experience in
mind. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Sentiment analysis using deep learning and pre-trained language models (PLMs)
has gained significant traction due to their ability to capture rich contextual
representations. However, existing approaches often underperform in scenarios
involving nuanced emotional cues, domain shifts, and imbalanced sentiment
distributions. We argue that these limitations stem from inadequate semantic
grounding, poor generalization to diverse linguistic patterns, and biases
toward dominant sentiment classes. To overcome these challenges, we propose
CISEA-MRFE, a novel PLM-based framework integrating Contextual Instruction
(CI), Semantic Enhancement Augmentation (SEA), and Multi-Refined Feature
Extraction (MRFE). CI injects domain-aware directives to guide sentiment
disambiguation; SEA improves robustness through sentiment-consistent
paraphrastic augmentation; and MRFE combines a Scale-Adaptive Depthwise Encoder
(SADE) for multi-scale feature specialization with an Emotion Evaluator Context
Encoder (EECE) for affect-aware sequence modeling. Experimental results on four
benchmark datasets demonstrate that CISEA-MRFE consistently outperforms strong
baselines, achieving relative improvements in accuracy of up to 4.6% on IMDb,
6.5% on Yelp, 30.3% on Twitter, and 4.1% on Amazon. These results validate the
effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach for sentiment
classification across varied domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks
despite their impressive capabilities. Investigating these weaknesses is
crucial for robust safety mechanisms. Existing attacks primarily distract LLMs
by introducing additional context or adversarial tokens, leaving the core
harmful intent unchanged. In this paper, we introduce ISA (Intent Shift
Attack), which obfuscates LLMs about the intent of the attacks. More
specifically, we establish a taxonomy of intent transformations and leverage
them to generate attacks that may be misperceived by LLMs as benign requests
for information. Unlike prior methods relying on complex tokens or lengthy
context, our approach only needs minimal edits to the original request, and
yields natural, human-readable, and seemingly harmless prompts. Extensive
experiments on both open-source and commercial LLMs show that ISA achieves over
70% improvement in attack success rate compared to direct harmful prompts. More
critically, fine-tuning models on only benign data reformulated with ISA
templates elevates success rates to nearly 100%. For defense, we evaluate
existing methods and demonstrate their inadequacy against ISA, while exploring
both training-free and training-based mitigation strategies. Our findings
reveal fundamental challenges in intent inference for LLMs safety and
underscore the need for more effective defenses. Our code and datasets are

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing, achieving

an efficient implementation of EVA (Efficient Attention via Control Variates),
and demonstrate how to finetune transformers to adapt to FlashEVA attention.
Our method enables fine-tuning of Transformer models with as few as 1.5B tokens
while preserving effectiveness across various downstream tasks. Notably,
FlashEVA achieves up to 6.7x higher throughput and 5x lower peak GPU memory
usage during inference compared to standard Transformer implementations.
Despite these improvements, we observe limitations in retrieval-focused tasks.
Our implementation offers control over the trade-off between throughput and
accuracy through adjustable hyperparameters, providing flexibility for diverse
use cases. This work represents a significant step towards more efficient and

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning through reinforcement
learning rely on annotated datasets for verifiable rewards, which may limit
models' ability to surpass human-level performance. While self-play offers a
promising alternative, existing approaches depend on external verifiers or
cannot learn open-endedly. We present Open-Ended Self-Improving Reasoner
(OpenSIR), a self-play framework where an LLM learns to generate and solve
novel problems by alternating teacher and student roles without external
supervision. To generate novel problems, OpenSIR optimises for both difficulty
and diversity, rewarding problems that challenge appropriately while exploring
distinct concepts, enabling open-ended mathematical discovery. Starting from a
single trivial seed problem, OpenSIR substantially improves instruction models:
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct advances from 73.9 to 78.3 on GSM8K, and from 28.8 to
34.4 on College Math, while Gemma-2-2B-Instruct rises from 38.5 to 58.7 on
GSM8K. Our analyses reveal that OpenSIR achieves open-ended learning through
co-evolving teacher-student roles that adaptively calibrate difficulty and
drive diverse exploration, progressing autonomously from basic to advanced
mathematics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become the standard approach for accelerating Large
Language Model (LLM) inference. It exploits a lossless draft-then-verify
procedure to circumvent the latency of autoregressive decoding, achieving
impressive speed-ups. Yet, current speculative decoding approaches remain
limited by two fundamental bottlenecks: (1) the autoregressive dependency
during drafting which limits parallelism, and (2) frequent rejections of draft
tokens caused by misalignment between the draft and verify models. This paper
proposes SpecDiff-2, a novel framework to jointly address these two
bottlenecks. It leverages discrete diffusion as a non-autoregressive drafter to
address bottleneck (1) and develops novel techniques to calibrate discrete
diffusion drafters with autoregressive verifiers, addressing bottleneck (2).
Experimental results across a comprehensive benchmark suite show that
SpecDiff-2 achieves a new state-of-the-art across reasoning, coding, and
mathematical benchmarks, improving tokens-per-second by up to an average of
+55% over previous baselines and obtaining up to 5.5x average speed-up over
standard decoding, without any loss of accuracy.

deployed in decision-support and other knowledge-intensive applications. Model
certainty can be estimated from token logits, with derived probability and
entropy values offering insight into performance on the prompt task. However,
this approach may be inadequate for probabilistic scenarios, where the
probabilities of token outputs are expected to align with the theoretical
probabilities of the possible outcomes. We investigate the relationship between
token certainty and alignment with theoretical probability distributions in
well-defined probabilistic scenarios. Using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-Chat, we
evaluate model responses to ten prompts involving probability (e.g., roll a
six-sided die), both with and without explicit probability cues in the prompt
(e.g., roll a fair six-sided die). We measure two dimensions: (1) response
validity with respect to scenario constraints, and (2) alignment between
token-level output probabilities and theoretical probabilities. Our results
indicate that, while both models achieve perfect in-domain response accuracy
across all prompt scenarios, their token-level probability and entropy values
consistently diverge from the corresponding theoretical distributions.

Abstract: This research explores the evolution of the detective archetype in French
detective fiction through computational analysis. Using quantitative methods
and character-level embeddings, we show that a supervised model is able to
capture the unity of the detective archetype across 150 years of literature,
from M. Lecoq (1866) to Commissaire Adamsberg (2017). Building on this finding,
the study demonstrates how the detective figure evolves from a secondary
narrative role to become the central character and the "reasoning machine" of
the classical detective story. In the aftermath of the Second World War, with
the importation of the hardboiled tradition into France, the archetype becomes
more complex, navigating the genre's turn toward social violence and moral
ambiguity.

Abstract: Most multilingual question-answering benchmarks, while covering a diverse
pool of languages, do not factor in regional diversity in the information they
capture and tend to be Western-centric. This introduces a significant gap in
fairly evaluating multilingual models' comprehension of factual information
from diverse geographical locations. To address this, we introduce XNationQA
for investigating the cultural literacy of multilingual LLMs. XNationQA
encompasses a total of 49,280 questions on the geography, culture, and history
of nine countries, presented in seven languages. We benchmark eight standard
multilingual LLMs on XNationQA and evaluate them using two novel transference
metrics. Our analyses uncover a considerable discrepancy in the models'
accessibility to culturally specific facts across languages. Notably, we often
find that a model demonstrates greater knowledge of cultural information in
English than in the dominant language of the respective culture. The models
exhibit better performance in Western languages, although this does not
necessarily translate to being more literate for Western countries, which is
counterintuitive. Furthermore, we observe that models have a very limited
ability to transfer knowledge across languages, particularly evident in
open-source models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment after training and
tuning, yet recent work shows that safety can be bypassed through jailbreak
attacks. While many jailbreaks and defenses exist, their cross-lingual
generalization remains underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic
multilingual evaluation of jailbreaks and defenses across ten languages --
spanning high-, medium-, and low-resource languages -- using six LLMs on
HarmBench and AdvBench. We assess two jailbreak types: logical-expression-based
and adversarial-prompt-based. For both types, attack success and defense
robustness vary across languages: high-resource languages are safer under
standard queries but more vulnerable to adversarial ones. Simple defenses can
be effective, but are language- and model-dependent. These findings call for
language-aware and cross-lingual safety benchmarks for LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) and propose targeted improvements that enhance long-context modeling. A
key insight is that alternating between local (sliding-window) and global
(compression, selective) attention across layers, rather than using fixed
patterns, enables more effective propagation of long-range dependencies and
substantially boosts performance on long-sequence tasks. Meanwhile, we further
refine NSA's branches with Latent Attention that the sliding-window branch is
enhanced with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) while compression and selective
branches adopt Group-head Latent Attention (GLA). These changes reduce KV-cache
memory by 50\% versus NSA while improving the model's common-sense reasoning
and long-text understanding capabilities. Experiments on models from 340M to
1.3B parameters (trained on 15B and 100B tokens) show our method matches or
exceeds full attention and native sparse attention in both common-sense
reasoning and long-context understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The increasing utilization of large language models raises significant
concerns about the propagation of social biases, which may result in harmful
and unfair outcomes. However, existing debiasing methods treat the biased and
unbiased samples independently, thus ignoring their mutual relationship. This
oversight enables a hidden negative-positive coupling, where improvements for
one group inadvertently compromise the other, allowing residual social bias to
persist. In this paper, we introduce TriCon-Fair, a contrastive learning
framework that employs a decoupled loss that combines triplet and language
modeling terms to eliminate positive-negative coupling. Our TriCon-Fair assigns
each anchor an explicitly biased negative and an unbiased positive, decoupling
the push-pull dynamics and avoiding positive-negative coupling, and jointly
optimizes a language modeling (LM) objective to preserve general capability.
Experimental results demonstrate that TriCon-Fair reduces discriminatory output
beyond existing debiasing baselines while maintaining strong downstream
performance. This suggests that our proposed TriCon-Fair offers a practical and
ethical solution for sensitive NLP applications.

Abstract: Step-by-step reasoning has become a standard approach for large language
models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks. While this paradigm has proven
effective, it raises a fundamental question: How can we verify that an LLM's
reasoning is accurately grounded in knowledge? To address this question, we
introduce a novel evaluation suite that systematically assesses the knowledge
grounding of intermediate reasoning. Our framework comprises three key
components. (1) Principal Knowledge Collection, a large-scale repository of
atomic knowledge essential for reasoning. Based on the collection, we propose
(2) knowledge-grounded evaluation metrics designed to measure how well models
recall and apply prerequisite knowledge in reasoning. These metrics are
computed by our (3) evaluator LLM, a lightweight model optimized for
cost-effective and reliable metric computation. Our evaluation suite
demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in identifying missing or misapplied
knowledge elements, providing crucial insights for uncovering fundamental
reasoning deficiencies in LLMs. Beyond evaluation, we demonstrate how these
metrics can be integrated into preference optimization, showcasing further
applications of knowledge-grounded evaluation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has proven practical when models require

for multimodal document retrieval often replicate techniques developed for
text-only retrieval, whether in how they encode documents, define training
objectives, or compute similarity scores. To address these limitations, we
present ColMate, a document retrieval model that bridges the gap between
multimodal representation learning and document retrieval. ColMate utilizes a
novel OCR-based pretraining objective, a self-supervised masked contrastive
learning objective, and a late interaction scoring mechanism more relevant to
multimodal document structures and visual characteristics. ColMate obtains
3.61% improvements over existing retrieval models on the ViDoRe V2 benchmark,
demonstrating stronger generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks.

Yet their ability to produce outputs that are both understandable and

diagnostic scenarios, assessing understandability using readability metrics as
a proxy and empathy through LLM-as-a-Judge ratings compared to human
evaluations. The results indicate that LLMs adapt explanations to
socio-demographic variables and patient conditions. However, they also generate
overly complex content and display biased affective empathy, leading to uneven

Abstract: The extent to which large language models (LLMs) can perform culturally
grounded reasoning across non-English languages remains underexplored. This
paper examines the reasoning and self-assessment abilities of LLMs across seven
major Indian languages-Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and
Telugu. We introduce a multilingual riddle dataset combining traditional
riddles with context-reconstructed variants and evaluate five LLMs-Gemini 2.5
Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Mistral-Saba, LLaMA 4 Scout, and LLaMA 4 Maverick-under
seven prompting strategies. In the first stage, we assess riddle-solving
performance and find that while Gemini 2.5 Pro performs best overall, few-shot
methods yield only marginal gains, and accuracy varies notably across
languages. In the second stage, we conduct a self-evaluation experiment to
measure reasoning consistency. The results reveal a key finding: a model's
initial accuracy is inversely correlated with its ability to identify its own
mistakes. Top-performing models such as Gemini 2.5 Pro are overconfident (4.34%
True Negative Rate), whereas lower-performing models like LLaMA 4 Scout are
substantially more self-aware (42.09% True Negative Rate). These results point
to clear gaps in multilingual reasoning and highlight the need for models that
not only reason effectively but also recognize their own limitations.

Abstract: Existing machine-generated text (MGT) detection methods implicitly assume
labels as the "golden standard". However, we reveal boundary ambiguity in MGT
detection, implying that traditional training paradigms are inexact. Moreover,
limitations of human cognition and the superintelligence of detectors make
inexact learning widespread and inevitable. To this end, we propose an
easy-to-hard enhancement framework to provide reliable supervision under such
inexact conditions. Distinct from knowledge distillation, our framework employs
an easy supervisor targeting relatively simple longer-text detection tasks
(despite weaker capabilities), to enhance the more challenging target detector.
Firstly, longer texts targeted by supervisors theoretically alleviate the
impact of inexact labels, laying the foundation for reliable supervision.
Secondly, by structurally incorporating the detector into the supervisor, we
theoretically model the supervisor as a lower performance bound for the
detector. Thus, optimizing the supervisor indirectly optimizes the detector,
ultimately approximating the underlying "golden" labels. Extensive experiments
across diverse practical scenarios, including cross-LLM, cross-domain, mixed
text, and paraphrase attacks, demonstrate the framework's significant detection
effectiveness. The code is available at:

Abstract: Translating natural language to SQL remains difficult for complex queries.
Such queries often need environmental interaction and self-correction. To
address this, we introduce MARS-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that
combines principled task decomposition and interactive reinforcement learning
(RL). Our system comprises three specialized agents: a Grounding Agent for
schema linking, a Generation Agent for query generation, and a Validation Agent
for final selection. The core of our framework is the Generation agent, which
is trained via a multi-turn RL policy. Adopting a ReAct-style Think-Act-Observe
loop, the agent iteratively generates thoughts, executes SQL actions against a
live database, and revises its strategy based on execution feedback, enabling
dynamic, stateful reasoning and self-correction. At inference time, we generate
multiple interaction trajectories to explore diverse reasoning paths. The
Validation agent, then selects the optimal trajectory by modeling verification
as a next-token prediction task and choosing the solution with the highest
generation probability. This structured workflow pipelines specialized agents.
It combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for
verification. The approach proves highly effective for robust and accurate SQL
generation. Experiments show that MARS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art Execution
Accuracy of 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set. Our
code is available at https://github.com/YangHaolin0526/MARS-SQL.

Abstract: Instruction following is a fundamental ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), requiring their generated outputs to follow multiple constraints
imposed in input instructions. Numerous studies have attempted to enhance this
ability through preference optimization or reinforcement learning based on
reward signals from LLM-as-a-Judge. However, existing evaluation models for
instruction following still possess many deficiencies, such as substantial
costs and unreliable assessments. To this end, we propose IF-CRITIC, an LLM
critic that can provide efficient and reliable assessments of constraint
following in the instructions. We first develop a checklist generator to
decompose instructions and generate constraint checklists. With the assistance
of the checklists, we collect high-quality critique training data through a
multi-stage critique filtering mechanism and employ a constraint-level
preference optimization method to train IF-CRITIC. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the evaluation performance of IF-CRITIC can beat strong
LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, including Deepseek-R1 and o4-mini. With the scalable
reward signals provided by IF-CRITIC, LLMs can achieve substantial performance
gains in instruction-following optimization under lower computational overhead
compared to strong LLM critic baselines.

Abstract: Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an
increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users
are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with
LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a
small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user
interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a
multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates
prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained
reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and
reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports
both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on
multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline
models across tasks. Our code is publicly available at

filtering (e.g., educational value, topic, format) to generate high-quality
pretraining datasets. Our experiments show noteworthy trends in the topics
present in Romanian and English data, while also proving the effectiveness of
filtering data through improved LLM pretraining performance across multiple

Abstract: Reasoning over temporal and numerical data, such as time series, is a crucial
aspect of fact-checking. While many systems have recently been developed to
handle this form of evidence, their evaluation remains limited by existing
datasets, which often lack structured evidence, provide insufficient
justifications for verdicts, or rely on synthetic claims. In this paper, we
introduce TSVer, a new benchmark dataset for fact verification focusing on
temporal and numerical reasoning with time-series evidence. TSVer contains 287
real-world claims sourced from 38 fact-checking organizations and a curated
database of 400 time series covering diverse domains. Each claim is annotated
with time frames across all pertinent time series, along with a verdict and
justifications reflecting how the evidence is used to reach the verdict. Using
an LLM-assisted multi-step annotation process, we improve the quality of our
annotations and achieve an inter-annotator agreement of kappa=0.745 on
verdicts. We also develop a baseline for verifying claims against time-series
evidence and show that even the state-of-the-art reasoning models like
Gemini-2.5-Pro are challenged by time series, achieving a 63.37 accuracy score
on verdicts and an Ev2R score of 48.63 on verdict justifications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with agent-based reasoning frameworks

microservice remediation, where the goal is to automatically recover faulty
microservice systems. Existing approaches, however, still rely on human-crafted

textual instructions into executable code. To advance research in this area, we
introduce MicroRemed, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in end-to-end
microservice remediation, where models must directly generate executable
Ansible playbooks from diagnosis reports to restore system functionality. We
further propose ThinkRemed, a multi-agent framework that emulates the

Abstract: Salespeople frequently face the dynamic screening decision of whether to
persist in a conversation or abandon it to pursue the next lead. Yet, little is
known about how these decisions are made, whether they are efficient, or how to
improve them. We study these decisions in the context of high-volume outbound
sales where leads are ample, but time is scarce and failure is common. We
formalize the dynamic screening decision as an optimal stopping problem and
develop a generative language model-based sequential decision agent - a
stopping agent - that learns whether and when to quit conversations by
imitating a retrospectively-inferred optimal stopping policy. Our approach
handles high-dimensional textual states, scales to large language models, and
works with both open-source and proprietary language models. When applied to
calls from a large European telecommunications firm, our stopping agent reduces
the time spent on failed calls by 54% while preserving nearly all sales;
reallocating the time saved increases expected sales by up to 37%. Upon
examining the linguistic cues that drive salespeople's quitting decisions, we
find that they tend to overweight a few salient expressions of consumer
disinterest and mispredict call failure risk, suggesting cognitive bounds on
their ability to make real-time conversational decisions. Our findings
highlight the potential of artificial intelligence algorithms to correct
cognitively-bounded human decisions and improve salesforce efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed for open-ended
communication, yet most bias evaluations still rely on English,
classification-style tasks. We introduce DebateBias-8K, a new multilingual,
debate-style benchmark designed to reveal how narrative bias appears in
realistic generative settings. Our dataset includes 8,400 structured debate
prompts spanning four sensitive domains: women's rights, socioeconomic
development, terrorism, and religion, across seven languages ranging from
high-resource (English, Chinese) to low-resource (Swahili, Nigerian Pidgin).
Using four flagship models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, DeepSeek, and LLaMA 3), we
generate and automatically classify over 100,000 responses. Results show that
all models reproduce entrenched stereotypes despite safety alignment: Arabs are
overwhelmingly linked to terrorism and religion (>=95%), Africans to
socioeconomic "backwardness" (up to <=77%), and Western groups are consistently
framed as modern or progressive. Biases grow sharply in lower-resource
languages, revealing that alignment trained primarily in English does not
generalize globally. Our findings highlight a persistent divide in multilingual
fairness: current alignment methods reduce explicit toxicity but fail to
prevent biased outputs in open-ended contexts. We release our DebateBias-8K
benchmark and analysis framework to support the next generation of multilingual
bias evaluation and safer, culturally inclusive model alignment.

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news threatens social stability and public trust,
rendering its detection an imperative research priority. Although large
language models (LLMs) excel at numerous natural language processing tasks with
their remarkable contextual understanding and extensive prior knowledge, the
time-bounded knowledge coverage and tendency for generating hallucination
content reduce their reliability when handling fast-evolving news streams.
Furthermore, models trained on existing static datasets also often lack the
generalization needed for emerging news topics. To address these challenges, we
propose ZoFia, a novel two-stage zero-shot fake news detection framework.
First, we introduce Hierarchical Salience to quantify the importance of
entities in the news content, and propose the SC-MMR algorithm to effectively
select an informative and diverse set of keywords that serve as queries for
retrieving up-to-date external evidence. Subsequently, a multi LLM interactive
system, in which each agent assumes a distinct role, performs multi-view
collaborative analysis and adversarial debate over the news text and its
related information, and finally produces an interpretable and robust judgment.
Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ZoFia
obviously outperforms existing zero-shot baselines and most of few-shot
methods. Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related communities.

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) offers a label-free paradigm for
adapting models using only synthetic signals at inference, but its success
hinges on constructing reliable learning signals. Standard approaches such as
majority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce
Self-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer
should remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase.
Self-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two
complementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the
input. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of
majority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and
reframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally
selects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap
of favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human
supervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks,
Self-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time
setting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods. Beyond
accuracy, it demonstrates unprecedented robustness, with zero training failures
in all experiments, underscoring its stability and reliability.

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) has emerged as a critical challenge,
driven by the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) capable of
producing highly realistic, human-like content. However, the performance of
current approaches often degrades significantly under domain shift. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel framework designed to capture both
domain-specific and domain-general MGT patterns through a two-stage
Disentangled mixturE-of-ExpeRts (DEER) architecture. First, we introduce a
disentangled mixture-of-experts module, in which domain-specific experts learn
fine-grained, domain-local distinctions between human and machine-generated
text, while shared experts extract transferable, cross-domain features. Second,
to mitigate the practical limitation of unavailable domain labels during
inference, we design a reinforcement learning-based routing mechanism that
dynamically selects the appropriate experts for each input instance,
effectively bridging the train-inference gap caused by domain uncertainty.
Extensive experiments on five in-domain and five out-of-domain benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DEER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving average F1-score improvements of 1.39% and 5.32% on
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets respectively, along with accuracy gains of
1.35% and 3.61% respectively. Ablation studies confirm the critical
contributions of both disentangled expert specialization and adaptive routing
to model performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of domain specificity on abstractive
summarisation of Arabic financial texts using large language models (LLMs). We
introduce AraFinNews, the largest publicly available Arabic financial news
dataset to date, comprising 212,500 article-headline pairs spanning nearly a
decade of reporting from October 2015 to July 2025. Designed as the Arabic
equivalent of major English summarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail,
AraFinNews provides a robust benchmark for evaluating domain-specific language
understanding and generation in financial contexts. Using this resource, we
evaluate transformer-based models -- including mT5, AraT5, and the
domain-adapted FinAraT5 -- to examine how financial-domain pretraining
influences factual accuracy, numerical reliability, and stylistic alignment
with professional reporting. Experimental results show that domain-adapted
models generate more faithful and coherent summaries, particularly in handling
quantitative and entity-centric information. The findings highlight the
importance of domain-specific adaptation for improving factual consistency and
narrative fluency in Arabic financial summarisation. The dataset is freely
available for non-commercial research at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as an effective technique to accelerate
large language model (LLM) inference without compromising output quality.
However, the achievable speedup largely depends on the effectiveness of the
drafting model. While model-based methods like EAGLE-2 are accurate but costly,
retrieval-enhanced methods like SAM-Decoding rely on heuristic switching
strategies that often trigger unnecessary retrievals. To address this, we
propose ReSpec (\textbf{Re}trieval-enhanced \textbf{Spe}culative Decoding), a
novel framework that transforms heuristic drafter switching into adaptive
decision-making. ReSpec features three core innovations: 1) An
\textbf{entropy-guided adaptive trigger} quantifies contextual predictability
to initiate retrieval only when uncertainty is low, avoiding costly low-quality
speculations. 2) A \textbf{feedback-driven candidate selection} leverages
historical feedback to organize multiple high-quality candidates for parallel
verification, maximizing retrieval utility. 3) A source-aware \textbf{relaxed
verification strategy} applies strict checks to model-generated drafts while
using a relaxed verification for retrieved drafts, achieving a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench
demonstrate that ReSpec achieves state-of-the-art acceleration,outperforming
EAGLE-2 and SAM-Decoding by over $33\%$ and $25\%$, respectively, while
maintaining output quality.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI models, their deployment across diverse
tasks has become increasingly widespread. A notable emerging application is
leveraging AI models to assist in reviewing scientific papers. However, recent
reports have revealed that some papers contain hidden, injected prompts
designed to manipulate AI reviewers into providing overly favorable
evaluations. In this work, we present an early systematic investigation into
this emerging threat. We propose two classes of attacks: (1) static attack,
which employs a fixed injection prompt, and (2) iterative attack, which
optimizes the injection prompt against a simulated reviewer model to maximize
its effectiveness. Both attacks achieve striking performance, frequently
inducing full evaluation scores when targeting frontier AI reviewers.
Furthermore, we show that these attacks are robust across various settings. To
counter this threat, we explore a simple detection-based defense. While it
substantially reduces the attack success rate, we demonstrate that an adaptive
attacker can partially circumvent this defense. Our findings underscore the
need for greater attention and rigorous safeguards against prompt-injection
threats in AI-assisted peer review.

Abstract: In emergency situations, every second counts. The deployment of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in time-sensitive, low or zero-connectivity environments
remains limited. Current models are computationally intensive and unsuitable
for low-tier devices often used by first responders or civilians. A major
barrier to developing lightweight, domain-specific solutions is the lack of
high-quality datasets tailored to first aid and emergency response. To address
this gap, we introduce FirstAidQA, a synthetic dataset containing 5,500
high-quality question answer pairs that encompass a wide range of first aid and
emergency response scenarios. The dataset was generated using a Large Language
Model, ChatGPT-4o-mini, with prompt-based in-context learning, using texts from
the Vital First Aid Book (2019). We applied preprocessing steps such as text
cleaning, contextual chunking, and filtering, followed by human validation to
ensure accuracy, safety, and practical relevance of the QA pairs. FirstAidQA is
designed to support instruction-tuning and fine-tuning of LLMs and Small
Language Models (SLMs), enabling faster, more reliable, and offline-capable
systems for emergency settings. We publicly release the dataset to advance
research on safety-critical and resource-constrained AI applications in first
aid and emergency response. The dataset is available on Hugging Face at

Abstract: 5G technology enables mobile Internet access for billions of users. Answering
expert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of
pages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific
approaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve
cross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs,
a RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three
metadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB
(line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents).
DeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving
referenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution
by mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design
rationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world
questions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350
evolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across
multiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art
telecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution
and evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality,
underscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G
standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with integrated search tools show strong promise
in open-domain question answering (QA), yet they often struggle to produce
complete answer set to complex questions such as Which actor from the film Heat
won at least one Academy Award?, which requires (1) distinguishing between
multiple films sharing the same title and (2) reasoning across a large set of
actors to gather and integrate evidence. Existing QA benchmarks rarely evaluate
both challenges jointly. To address this, we introduce DeepAmbigQAGen, an
automatic data generation pipeline that constructs QA tasks grounded in text
corpora and linked knowledge graph, generating natural and verifiable questions
that systematically embed name ambiguity and multi-step reasoning. Based on
this, we build DeepAmbigQA, a dataset of 3,600 questions requiring multi-hop
reasoning and half of them explicit name ambiguity resolving. Experiments
reveal that, even state-of-the-art GPT-5 show incomplete answers, achieving
only 0.13 exact match on ambiguous questions and 0.21 on non-ambiguous
questions. These findings highlight the need for more robust QA systems aimed
at information gathering and answer completeness.

Abstract: Recently, the demand for small and efficient reasoning models to support

techniques that balance reasoning performance and inference speed. In this
paper, we further extend the DistilQwen model family, initialized from the Qwen
models, by introducing four model series specifically designed to meet
industrial requirements. The distilled model collection comprises: (1)
slow-thinking models, optimized for reasoning tasks that require high accuracy;
(2) two series of adaptive-thinking models, which dynamically adjust reasoning
strategies based on input tasks to maximize efficiency across diverse
scenarios; and (3) distilled reward models, which enable further reinforcement
learning of reasoning models using distilled knowledge. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate both high inference
efficiency and strong reasoning performance for these models, as well as the
practical utility of distilled reward models. We further show that these models
support industry practitioners by providing scalable training and inference
functionalities on the Alibaba Cloud PAI (Platform for Artificial Intelligence)
platform.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have been used in various ways to
improve the factuality of LLM outputs. This is typically done by applying an
NLI model to judge whether the model output is entailed from the supposed
evidence, triggering some corrective actions, such as beam reranking at
inference time or RL rewards during training. While NLI models are trained to
detect factual inconsistencies over complete sentences, decisions in the common
autoregressive generation architecture are made for each evolving text prefix,
during decoding. Addressing this setting, we generalize the entailment
detection task to apply over arbitrary text prefixes, and suggest its utility
for improving generation faithfulness. Providing suitable evaluation and
training datasets for this task, we train MiniTruePrefixes, a novel specialized
model that better detects factual inconsistencies over text prefixes,
outperforming comparable baseline NLI models by 5-14 F1 points in prefix-level
entailment. We further demonstrate that integrating MiniTruePrefixes into a
controlled decoding framework substantially improves factual consistency in
abstractive summarization. When guided by MiniTruePrefixes,
LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct matches the faithfulness and runtime of the 8B model from
the same model family, while using only half the memory.

Abstract: Increasingly, more and more people are turning to large language models

pre-existing medical benchmarks literature which seeks to accomplish this very
task, these benchmarks are almost universally in English, which has led to a
notable gap in existing literature pertaining to multilingual LLM evaluation.
Within this work, we seek to aid in addressing this gap with Cancer-Myth-Indic,
an Indic language benchmark built by translating a 500-item subset of
Cancer-Myth, sampled evenly across its original categories, into five
under-served but widely used languages from the subcontinent (500 per language;
2,500 translated items total). Native-speaker translators followed a style
guide for preserving implicit presuppositions in translation; items feature
false presuppositions relating to cancer. We evaluate several popular LLMs
under this presupposition stress.

Abstract: The rapid rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models

assess them. However, due to both improved model competence resulting from
scaling and novel training advances as well as likely many of these datasets
being included in pre or post training data, results become saturated, driving
a continuous need for new and more challenging replacements. In this paper, we
discuss whether surpassing a benchmark truly demonstrates reasoning ability or
are we simply tracking numbers divorced from the capabilities we claim to
measure? We present an investigation focused on three model families, OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google, and how their reasoning capabilities across different
benchmarks evolve over the years. We also analyze performance trends over the
years across different reasoning tasks and discuss the current situation of
benchmarking and remaining challenges. By offering a comprehensive overview of
benchmarks and reasoning tasks, our work aims to serve as a first reference to
ground future research in reasoning evaluation and model development.

Abstract: The extent to which individual language characteristics influence
tokenization and language modeling is an open question. Differences in
morphological systems have been suggested as both unimportant and crucial to
consider (Cotterell et al., 2018; Gerz et al., 2018a; Park et al., 2021, inter
alia). We argue this conflicting evidence is due to confounding factors in
experimental setups, making it hard to compare results and draw conclusions. We
identify confounding factors in analyses trying to answer the question of
whether, and how, morphology relates to language modeling. Next, we re-assess
three hypotheses by Arnett & Bergen (2025) for why modeling agglutinative
languages results in higher perplexities than fusional languages: they look at
morphological alignment of tokenization, tokenization efficiency, and dataset
size. We show that each conclusion includes confounding factors. Finally, we
introduce token bigram metrics as an intrinsic way to predict the difficulty of
causal language modeling, and find that they are gradient proxies for
morphological complexity that do not require expert annotation. Ultimately, we
outline necessities to reliably answer whether, and how, morphology relates to
language modeling.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) quality depends on many interacting
choices across retrieval, ranking, augmentation, prompting, and generation, so
optimizing modules in isolation is brittle. We introduce RAGSmith, a modular
framework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine
technique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic
search optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics
(recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic
similarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law,
Finance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions
spanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds
configurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\% on
average (range +1.2\% to +6.9\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\% in
retrieval and +7.5\% in generation. The search typically explores $\approx
0.2\%$ of the space ($\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone --
vector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by
domain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt
reordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude
correlates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes
than interpretation-heavy sets. These results provide practical, domain-aware
guidance for assembling effective RAG systems and demonstrate the utility of
evolutionary search for full-pipeline optimization.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on question answering often relies on
static benchmarks that reward memorization and understate the role of
retrieval, failing to capture the dynamic nature of world knowledge. We present
LiveSearchBench, an automated pipeline for constructing retrieval-dependent
benchmarks from recent knowledge updates. Our method computes deltas between
successive Wikidata snapshots, filters candidate triples for quality, and
synthesizes natural-language questions at three levels of reasoning difficulty,
each guaranteed to admit a unique, verifiable answer through SPARQL validation.
The pipeline is fully automated, scalable across time, and minimizes human
intervention, enabling continual regeneration of temporally grounded
benchmarks. Experiments show a pronounced performance drop when models confront
facts that post-date pretraining, with the gap most salient on multi-hop
queries. Retrieval augmented methods and larger, instruction-tuned models
provide partial gains but fail to close this recency gap. By design,
LiveSearchBench shifts evaluation from static memorization toward tasks that
require up-to-date retrieval and reasoning, offering a foundation for
systematic, long-term assessment of LLMs under evolving knowledge.

Abstract: Translating a morphology-rich, low-resource language like Latin poses
significant challenges. This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based
refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a
performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our
method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality,
structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes
this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context
with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of
this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set
(Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of
12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source
RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline,
without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the
Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability

Abstract: While long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation effectively transfers
reasoning capability to smaller language models, the reasoning process often
remains redundant and computational budget uncontrollable, leading to
inefficient resource usage. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{Budget-Aware Reasoning Distillation (BARD)}, a novel framework that
simultaneously distills reasoning capability and enables fine-grained control
over the reasoning length. BARD uses the thinking budget as a user-specified
control signal, allowing the model to dynamically balance reasoning performance
and computational efficiency. To achieve this concept, BARD introduces a
two-phase training regimen. The first phase, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on
teacher-generated long CoT data compressed to various budget levels,
bootstrapping the model's understanding of budget constraints. The second phase
leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) from a reward signal in consideration of
reasoning performance and budget fidelity simultaneously. Incorporating the
two-phase regimen is crucial to avoiding policy degradation and ensuring that
both objectives are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method empowers an 8B student model to achieve strong performance on
challenging reasoning benchmarks (\textit{AIME24, AIME25, GPQA}) while
providing precise and adaptive control over its reasoning length across a wide
range of budgets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-based automated Cognitive Distortion detection is a challenging task due
to its subjective nature, with low agreement scores observed even among expert
human annotators, leading to unreliable annotations. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs) as consistent and reliable annotators, and propose
that multiple independent LLM runs can reveal stable labeling patterns despite
the inherent subjectivity of the task. Furthermore, to fairly compare models
trained on datasets with different characteristics, we introduce a
dataset-agnostic evaluation framework using Cohen's kappa as an effect size
measure. This methodology allows for fair cross-dataset and cross-study
comparisons where traditional metrics like F1 score fall short. Our results
show that GPT-4 can produce consistent annotations (Fleiss's Kappa = 0.78),
resulting in improved test set performance for models trained on these
annotations compared to those trained on human-labeled data. Our findings
suggest that LLMs can offer a scalable and internally consistent alternative
for generating training data that supports strong downstream performance in
subjective NLP tasks.

Abstract: As synthetic data becomes widely used in language model development,
understanding its impact on model behavior is crucial. This paper investigates
the impact of the diversity of sources of synthetic data on fine-tuned large
language models. We focus on three key dimensions: distribution collapse,
adversarial robustness, and self-preference bias. Our findings reveal that
fine-tuning models on synthetic data from diverse sources can mitigate
distribution collapse, preserving the breadth of the output distribution and
the diversity of the output text. Furthermore, while both human and synthetic
fine-tuning data can remove safeguards, the latter preserves higher output
quality, thus making outputs potentially more usable and dangerous. Finally,
fine-tuning reduces self-preference bias, with human data being the most
effective, followed by multi-source synthetic data.

Abstract: Toxic language in Bengali remains prevalent, especially in online
environments, with few effective precautions against it. Although text
detoxification has seen progress in high-resource languages, Bengali remains
underexplored due to limited resources. In this paper, we propose a novel
pipeline for Bengali text detoxification that combines Pareto class-optimized
large language models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate
detoxified sentences. To support this effort, we construct BanglaNirTox, an
artificially generated parallel corpus of 68,041 toxic Bengali sentences with
class-wise toxicity labels, reasonings, and detoxified paraphrases, using
Pareto-optimized LLMs evaluated on random samples. The resulting BanglaNirTox
dataset is used to fine-tune language models to produce better detoxified
versions of Bengali sentences. Our findings show that Pareto-optimized LLMs
with CoT prompting significantly enhance the quality and consistency of Bengali
text detoxification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multiple-choice cloze questions are commonly used to assess linguistic
proficiency and comprehension. However, generating high-quality distractors
remains challenging, as existing methods often lack adaptability and control
over difficulty levels, and the absence of difficulty-annotated datasets
further hinders progress. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework
for generating distractors with controllable difficulty by leveraging both data
augmentation and a multitask learning strategy. First, to create a
high-quality, difficulty-annotated dataset, we introduce a two-way distractor
generation process in order to produce diverse and plausible distractors. These
candidates are subsequently refined through filtering and then categorized by
difficulty using an ensemble QA system. Second, this newly created dataset is
leveraged to train a difficulty-controllable generation model via multitask
learning. The framework includes carefully designed auxiliary tasks that
enhance the model's semantic understanding of distractors and its ability to
estimate their difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
generates high-quality distractors across difficulty levels and substantially
outperforms GPT-4o in aligning distractor difficulty with human perception.

Abstract: Math anxiety poses significant challenges for university psychology students,
affecting their career choices and overall well-being. This study employs a
framework based on behavioural forma mentis networks (i.e. cognitive models
that map how individuals structure their associative knowledge and emotional
perceptions of concepts) to explore individual and group differences in the
perception and association of concepts related to math and anxiety. We
conducted 4 experiments involving psychology undergraduates from 2 samples (n1
= 70, n2 = 57) compared against GPT-simulated students (GPT-3.5: n2 = 300;
GPT-4o: n4 = 300). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 employ individual-level network
features to predict psychometric scores for math anxiety and its facets
(observational, social and evaluational) from the Math Anxiety Scale.
Experiment 4 focuses on group-level perceptions extracted from human students,
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o's networks. Results indicate that, in students, positive
valence ratings and higher network degree for "anxiety", together with negative
ratings for "math", can predict higher total and evaluative math anxiety. In
contrast, these models do not work on GPT-based data because of differences in
simulated networks and psychometric scores compared to humans. These results
were also reconciled with differences found in the ways that high/low subgroups
of simulated and real students framed semantically and emotionally STEM
concepts. High math-anxiety students collectively framed "anxiety" in an
emotionally polarising way, absent in the negative perception of low
math-anxiety students. "Science" was rated positively, but contrasted against
the negative perception of "math". These findings underscore the importance of
understanding concept perception and associations in managing students' math
anxiety.

Abstract: Controllable Dialogue Generation (CDG) enables chatbots to generate responses
with desired attributes, and weighted decoding methods have achieved
significant success in the CDG task. However, using a fixed constant value to
manage the bias of attribute probabilities makes it challenging to find an
ideal control strength that satisfies both controllability and fluency. To
address this issue, we propose ECO decoding (Entropy-based COntrol), which
dynamically adjusts the control strength at each generation step according to
the model's entropy in both the language model and attribute classifier
probability distributions. Experiments on the DailyDialog and MultiWOZ datasets
demonstrate that ECO decoding consistently improves controllability while
maintaining fluency and grammaticality, outperforming prior decoding methods
across various models and settings. Furthermore, ECO decoding alleviates
probability interpolation issues in multi-attribute generation and consequently
demonstrates strong performance in both single and multi-attribute scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Linguistic errors are not merely deviations from normative grammar; they
offer a unique window into the cognitive architecture of language and expose
the current limitations of artificial systems that seek to replicate them. This
project proposes an interdisciplinary study of linguistic errors produced by
native Spanish speakers, with the aim of analyzing how current large language
models (LLM) interpret, reproduce, or correct them. The research integrates
three core perspectives: theoretical linguistics, to classify and understand
the nature of the errors; neurolinguistics, to contextualize them within
real-time language processing in the brain; and natural language processing
(NLP), to evaluate their interpretation against linguistic errors. A
purpose-built corpus of authentic errors of native Spanish (+500) will serve as
the foundation for empirical analysis. These errors will be tested against AI
models such as GPT or Gemini to assess their interpretative accuracy and their
ability to generalize patterns of human linguistic behavior. The project
contributes not only to the understanding of Spanish as a native language but
also to the development of NLP systems that are more cognitively informed and
capable of engaging with the imperfect, variable, and often ambiguous nature of
real human language.

Abstract: ParlaSpeech is a collection of spoken parliamentary corpora currently
spanning four Slavic languages - Croatian, Czech, Polish and Serbian - all
together 6 thousand hours in size. The corpora were built in an automatic
fashion from the ParlaMint transcripts and their corresponding metadata, which
were aligned to the speech recordings of each corresponding parliament. In this
release of the dataset, each of the corpora is significantly enriched with
various automatic annotation layers. The textual modality of all four corpora
has been enriched with linguistic annotations and sentiment predictions.
Similar to that, their spoken modality has been automatically enriched with
occurrences of filled pauses, the most frequent disfluency in typical speech.
Two out of the four languages have been additionally enriched with detailed
word- and grapheme-level alignments, and the automatic annotation of the
position of primary stress in multisyllabic words. With these enrichments, the
usefulness of the underlying corpora has been drastically increased for
downstream research across multiple disciplines, which we showcase through an
analysis of acoustic correlates of sentiment. All the corpora are made
available for download in JSONL and TextGrid formats, as well as for search
through a concordancer.

potential of this architecture and identify its strengths and weaknesses.
Validation results show how the system correctly answers in about three out of
four of the cases (75.2 +- 2.7%), with higher results on questions related to
more general EE answers (up to 81.0 +- 4.1%), and featuring promising
multilingual abilities (4.4% accuracy loss due to translation).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to specialized,
high-stakes domains like engineering, which demands rigorous evaluation of
their complex reasoning capabilities. While current benchmarks assess language
understanding, factual recall, mathematics or code generation, none capture the
integrative reasoning central to engineering where scientific principles,
quantitative modeling and practical constraints must converge. To address this
gap, we introduce EngChain, a benchmark for verifiable multi-step engineering
problem-solving. EngChain contains 90 problems spanning three engineering
branches, organized into 9 domains and 20 distinct areas. The problems are
generated from symbolic templates with a high degree of randomization to ensure
diversity and eliminate the risk of contamination. With this benchmark, we move
beyond final answer accuracy with a two-stage evaluation: we first
quantitatively verify the numerical and semantic validity of each reasoning
step and then introduce LLM-As-A-Judge, an automated system to qualitatively
categorize the identified reasoning errors.

primarily supports 5 languages, namely Indonesian, Thai, Vietnamese, English,
and Chinese; 2) Multimodal: the model accepts flexible input modalities,
including audio only, text only, as well as audio with text; 3) Multi-task: the
model supports a wide range of tasks, including audio analysis tasks such as
Audio Captioning, Automatic Speech Recognition, Speech-to-Text Translation,
Speech Emotion Recognition, Speech Question Answering, and Speech
Summarization. It also enables voice-based dialogue, including answering
factual, mathematical, and general knowledge queries. As a significant step
towards advancing audio LLMs in Southeast Asia, we expect SeaLLMs-Audio to
benefit both the regional research community and industry. To automate LALM

Abstract: The character of the "AI assistant" persona generated by modern chatbot large
language models influences both surface-level behavior and apparent values,
beliefs, and ethics. These all affect interaction quality, perceived
intelligence, and alignment with both developer and user intentions. The
shaping of this persona, known as character training, is a critical component
of industry post-training, yet remains effectively unstudied in the academic
literature. We introduce the first open implementation of character training,
leveraging Constitutional AI and a new data pipeline using synthetic
introspective data to shape the assistant persona in a more effective and
controlled manner than alternatives such as constraining system prompts or
activation steering. Specifically, we fine-tune three popular open-weights
models using 11 example personas, such as humorous, deeply caring, or even
malevolent. To track the effects of our approach, we introduce a method which
analyzes revealed preferences, uncovering clear and holistic changes in
character. We find these changes are more robust to adversarial prompting than
the above two alternatives, while also leading to more coherent and realistic
generations. Finally, we demonstrate this fine-tuning has little to no effect
on general capabilities as measured by common benchmarks. We describe and
open-source our full post-training method, the implementation of which can be
found at https://github.com/maiush/OpenCharacterTraining.

Abstract: Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) describe how Large Language Models
(LLMs) make decisions, drawing on both external Context Knowledge (CK) and
Parametric Knowledge (PK) stored in model weights. Understanding their
interaction is key to assessing the grounding of NLEs, yet it remains
underexplored. Prior work has largely examined only single-step generation,
typically the final answer, and has modelled PK and CK interaction only as a
binary choice in a rank-1 subspace. This overlooks richer forms of interaction,
such as complementary or supportive knowledge. We propose a novel rank-2
projection subspace that disentangles PK and CK contributions more accurately
and use it for the first multi-step analysis of knowledge interactions across
longer NLE sequences. Experiments on four QA datasets and three open-weight
instruction-tuned LLMs show that diverse knowledge interactions are poorly
represented in a rank-1 subspace but are effectively captured in our rank-2
formulation. Our multi-step analysis reveals that hallucinated NLEs align
strongly with the PK direction, context-faithful ones balance PK and CK, and
Chain-of-Thought prompting for NLEs shifts generated NLEs toward CK by reducing
PK reliance. This work provides the first framework for systematic studies of
multi-step knowledge interactions in LLMs through a richer rank-2 subspace
disentanglement. Code and data:

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language model (LM) assistants are increasingly used in applications such as
brainstorming and research. Improvements in memory and context size have
allowed these models to become more autonomous, which has also resulted in more
text accumulation in their context windows without explicit user intervention.
This comes with a latent risk: the belief profiles of models -- their
understanding of the world as manifested in their responses or actions -- may
silently change as context accumulates. This can lead to subtly inconsistent
user experiences, or shifts in behavior that deviate from the original
alignment of the models. In this paper, we explore how accumulating context by
engaging in interactions and processing text -- talking and reading -- can
change the beliefs of language models, as manifested in their responses and
behaviors.Our results reveal that models' belief profiles are highly malleable:
GPT-5 exhibits a 54.7% shift in its stated beliefs after 10 rounds of
discussion about moral dilemmas and queries about safety, while Grok 4 shows a
27.2% shift on political issues after reading texts from the opposing position.
We also examine models' behavioral changes by designing tasks that require tool
use, where each tool selection corresponds to an implicit belief. We find that
these changes align with stated belief shifts, suggesting that belief shifts
will be reflected in actual behavior in agentic systems. Our analysis exposes
the hidden risk of belief shift as models undergo extended sessions of talking
or reading, rendering their opinions and actions unreliable.

Abstract: Length control in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial but
under-addressed challenge, with applications ranging from voice interfaces
requiring concise responses to research summaries needing comprehensive
outputs. Current approaches to length control, including Regularized DPO,
Length-Instruction Fine Tuning, and tool-augmented methods, typically require
expensive model retraining or complex inference-time tooling. This paper
presents a prompt engineering methodology that enables precise length control
without model retraining. Our structure-guided approach implements deliberate
planning and word counting mechanisms within the prompt, encouraging the model
to carefully track and adhere to specified length constraints. Comprehensive
evaluations across six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our method
significantly improves length fidelity for several models compared to standard
prompting when applied to document summarization tasks, particularly for
shorter-to-medium length constraints. The proposed technique shows varying
benefits across different model architectures, with some models demonstrating
up to 37.6% improvement in length adherence. Quality evaluations further reveal
that our approach maintains or enhances overall output quality compared to
standard prompting techniques. Our approach provides an immediately deployable
solution for applications requiring precise length control, particularly
valuable for production environments where model retraining is impractical or
cost-prohibitive.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient
key-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation
turns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and
chat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or
force recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that
compresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on
classical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation,
adaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial
calibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies
in KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\times$ compression while maintaining
reasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\times$ or higher for specific use
cases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across
benchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and
MATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token
eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher
compression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block
for memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.

existing evaluations are either too easy or only focus on getting correct short
answers. To address these issues, we present IMO-Bench, a suite of advanced
reasoning benchmarks, vetted by a panel of top specialists and that
specifically targets the level of the International Mathematical Olympiad

first tests models on 400 diverse Olympiad problems with verifiable short

capabilities, which includes both basic and advanced IMO level problems as well
as detailed grading guidelines to facilitate automatic grading. These
benchmarks played a crucial role in our historic achievement of the gold-level
performance at IMO 2025 with Gemini Deep Think (Luong and Lockhart, 2025). Our
model achieved 80.0% on IMO-AnswerBench and 65.7% on the advanced IMO-Proof
Bench, surpassing the best non-Gemini models by large margins of 6.9% and 42.4%
respectively. We also showed that autograders built with Gemini reasoning
correlate well with human evaluations and construct IMO-GradingBench, with 1000

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of
sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context
Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match
queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures
fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent
selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that
embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects
them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool
capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent
Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that
agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented
without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together.
Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach
achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over
previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.

Abstract: In the current digital commerce landscape, user-generated reviews play a
critical role in shaping consumer behavior, product reputation, and platform
credibility. However, the proliferation of fake or misleading reviews often
generated by bots, paid agents, or AI models poses a significant threat to
trust and transparency within review ecosystems. Existing detection models
primarily rely on unimodal, typically textual, data and therefore fail to
capture semantic inconsistencies across different modalities. To address this
gap, a robust multimodal fake review detection framework is proposed,
integrating textual features encoded with BERT and visual features extracted
using ResNet-50. These representations are fused through a classification head
to jointly predict review authenticity. To support this approach, a curated
dataset comprising 21,142 user-uploaded images across food delivery,
hospitality, and e-commerce domains was utilized. Experimental results indicate
that the multimodal model outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving an F1-score
of 0.934 on the test set. Additionally, the confusion matrix and qualitative
analysis highlight the model's ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, such
as exaggerated textual praise paired with unrelated or low-quality images,
commonly found in deceptive content. This study demonstrates the critical role
of multimodal learning in safeguarding digital trust and offers a scalable
solution for content moderation across various online platforms.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing in retail requires policies that adapt to shifting demand
while coordinating decisions across related products. We present a systematic
empirical study of multi-agent reinforcement learning for retail price
optimization, comparing a strong MAPPO baseline with a
graph-attention-augmented variant (MAPPO+GAT) that leverages learned
interactions among products. Using a simulated pricing environment derived from
real transaction data, we evaluate profit, stability across random seeds,
fairness across products, and training efficiency under a standardized
evaluation protocol. The results indicate that MAPPO provides a robust and
reproducible foundation for portfolio-level price control, and that MAPPO+GAT
further enhances performance by sharing information over the product graph
without inducing excessive price volatility. These results indicate that
graph-integrated MARL provides a more scalable and stable solution than
independent learners for dynamic retail pricing, offering practical advantages
in multi-product decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models are now integrated into many scientific workflows,
accelerating data analysis, hypothesis generation, and design space
exploration. In parallel with this growth, there is a growing need to carefully
evaluate whether models accurately capture domain-specific knowledge and
notation, since general-purpose benchmarks rarely reflect these requirements.
This gap is especially clear in quantum science, which features non-intuitive
phenomena and requires advanced mathematics. In this study, we introduce
QuantumBench, a benchmark for the quantum domain that systematically examine
how well LLMs understand and can be applied to this non-intuitive field. Using
publicly available materials, we compiled approximately 800 questions with
their answers spanning nine areas related to quantum science and organized them
into an eight-option multiple-choice dataset. With this benchmark, we evaluate
several existing LLMs and analyze their performance in the quantum domain,
including sensitivity to changes in question format. QuantumBench is the first
LLM evaluation dataset built for the quantum domain, and it is intended to
guide the effective use of LLMs in quantum research.

Abstract: In modern engineering practice, human engineers collaborate in specialized
teams to design complex products, with each expert completing their respective
tasks while communicating and exchanging results and data with one another.
While this division of expertise is essential for managing multidisciplinary
complexity, it demands substantial development time and cost. Recently, we
introduced OpenFOAMGPT (1.0, 2.0), which functions as an autonomous AI engineer
for computational fluid dynamics, and turbulence.ai, which can conduct
end-to-end research in fluid mechanics draft publications and PhD theses.
Building upon these foundations, we present Engineering.ai, a platform for
teams of AI engineers in computational design. The framework employs a
hierarchical multi-agent architecture where a Chief Engineer coordinates
specialized agents consisting of Aerodynamics, Structural, Acoustic, and
Optimization Engineers, each powered by LLM with domain-specific knowledge.
Agent-agent collaboration is achieved through file-mediated communication for
data provenance and reproducibility, while a comprehensive memory system
maintains project context, execution history, and retrieval-augmented domain
knowledge to ensure reliable decision-making across the workflow. The system
integrates FreeCAD, Gmsh, OpenFOAM, CalculiX, and BPM acoustic analysis,
enabling parallel multidisciplinary simulations while maintaining computational
accuracy. The framework is validated through UAV wing optimization. This work
demonstrates that agentic-AI-enabled AI engineers has the potential to perform
complex engineering tasks autonomously. Remarkably, the automated workflow
achieved a 100% success rate across over 400 parametric configurations, with
zero mesh generation failures, solver convergence issues, or manual
interventions required, validating that the framework is trustworthy.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus remains one of the most compelling and
challenging benchmarks for tracking progress toward achieving Artificial
General Intelligence. In contrast to other evaluation datasets designed to
assess an agent's task-specific skills or accumulated knowledge, the ARC-AGI
suite is specifically targeted at measuring skill acquisition efficiency, a
trait that has (so far) been lacking in even the most sophisticated machine
learning systems. For algorithms that require extensive intra-task exemplars, a
significant constraint imposed by ARC-AGI is the modest cardinality of its
demonstration set, comprising a small number of $\langle$ input, output
$\rangle$ grids per task specifying the corresponding transformation. To
embellish the space of viable sample pairs, this paper introduces ARC-GEN, an
open-source procedural generator aimed at extending the original ARC-AGI
training dataset as faithfully as possible. Unlike prior efforts, our generator
is both exhaustive (covering all four-hundred tasks) and mimetic (more closely
honoring the distributional properties and characteristics embodied in the
initial ARC-AGI-1 release). We also discuss the use of this generator in
establishing a static benchmark suite to verify the correctness of programs
submitted to the 2025 Google Code Golf Championship.

Abstract: Cognitive science faces ongoing challenges in knowledge synthesis and
conceptual clarity, in part due to its multifaceted and interdisciplinary
nature. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly the
development of large language models (LLMs), offer tools that may help to
address these issues. This review examines how LLMs can support areas where the
field has historically struggled, including establishing cross-disciplinary
connections, formalizing theories, developing clear measurement taxonomies,
achieving generalizability through integrated modeling frameworks, and
capturing contextual and individual variation. We outline the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in these domains, including potential
pitfalls. Taken together, we conclude that LLMs can serve as tools for a more
integrative and cumulative cognitive science when used judiciously to
complement, rather than replace, human expertise.

Abstract: The rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into high-stakes legal
work has exposed a critical gap: no benchmark exists to systematically
stress-test their reliability against the nuanced, adversarial, and often
subtle flaws present in real-world contracts. To address this, we introduce
CLAUSE, a first-of-its-kind benchmark designed to evaluate the fragility of an
LLM's legal reasoning. We study the capabilities of LLMs to detect and reason
about fine-grained discrepancies by producing over 7500 real-world perturbed
contracts from foundational datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI. Our novel,
persona-driven pipeline generates 10 distinct anomaly categories, which are
then validated against official statutes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system to ensure legal fidelity. We use CLAUSE to evaluate leading LLMs'
ability to detect embedded legal flaws and explain their significance. Our
analysis shows a key weakness: these models often miss subtle errors and
struggle even more to justify them legally. Our work outlines a path to
identify and correct such reasoning failures in legal AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with the diverse and
evolving human values across different regions and cultures remains a critical
challenge in AI ethics. Current alignment approaches often yield superficial
conformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the
complex, context-dependent nature of human values. In this paper, we propose a
novel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical
decision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment
through deliberative ethical reasoning. Our framework consists of a structured
five-step process, including contextual fact gathering, hierarchical social
norm identification, option generation, multiple-lens ethical impact analysis,
and reflection. This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an
interpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand
regional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be
implemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods.
We perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for
regional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework
significantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to
baseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more
culturally appropriate reasoning. Our work provides a concrete pathway toward
developing LLMs that align more effectively with the multifaceted values of
global societies through interdisciplinary research.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly adopting and adapting Large Language Models
(LLMs) hosted on public repositories such as HuggingFace. Although these
adaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent
evidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness.
Since different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these
critical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their
trade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,
IA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model
families (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235
fine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and
nine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based
approaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least
disruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In
contrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce
safety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and
increased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:
LLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest
safety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation
layer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not
necessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single
configuration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an
inherent trade-off between these objectives. These findings suggest a practical
guideline for safety-critical deployments: begin with a well-aligned base
model, favour adapter-based PEFT, and conduct category-specific audits of both
safety and fairness.

Abstract: The recent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has become a pandemic and has
affected the entire globe. During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in
cases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.
Depression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it
difficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and
unwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use
online social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,
social media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be
utilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing
approaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of
social media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that
combines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among
social media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,
we propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets
and (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets. We also
extract five sets of features belonging to different modalities to describe a
user. Additionally, we introduce a Deep Learning model, the Visual Neural
Network (VNN), to generate embeddings of user-posted images, which are used to
create the visual feature vector for prediction. We contribute a curated
Covid-19 dataset of depressed and non-depressed users for research purposes and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in detecting depression during the
Covid-19 outbreak. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods over
a benchmark dataset by 2%-8% and produces promising results on the Covid-19
dataset. Our analysis highlights the impact of each modality and provides
valuable insights into users' mental and emotional states.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in diverse applications but face dual
challenges: generating harmful content under jailbreak attacks and over-refusal
of benign queries due to rigid safety mechanisms. These issues are further
complicated by the need to accommodate different value systems and precisely
align with given safety preferences. Moreover, traditional methods like SFT and
RLHF lack this capability due to their costly parameter tuning requirements and
inability to support multiple value systems within a single model. These
problems are more obvious in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
especially in terms of heightened over-refusal in cross-modal tasks and new
security risks arising from expanded attack surfaces. We propose Magic Image,
an optimization-driven visual prompt framework that enhances security while
reducing over-refusal. By optimizing image prompts using harmful/benign
samples, our method enables a single model to adapt to different value systems
and better align with given safety preferences without parameter updates.
Experiments demonstrate improved safety-effectiveness balance across diverse
datasets while preserving model performance, offering a practical solution for
deployable MLLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the
challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved
promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts
multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks
presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC)
problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on
centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic
conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all
intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model
compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design
include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning
and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on
queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length
definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions
but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows
for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With
probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the
proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was
comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale
regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.

Abstract: Personalized image preference assessment aims to evaluate an individual
user's image preferences by relying only on a small set of reference images as
prior information. Existing methods mainly focus on general preference
assessment, training models with large-scale data to tackle well-defined tasks
such as text-image alignment. However, these approaches struggle to handle
personalized preference because user-specific data are scarce and not easily
scalable, and individual tastes are often diverse and complex. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a common preference profile that serves as a
bridge across users, allowing large-scale user data to be leveraged for
training profile prediction and capturing complex personalized preferences.
Building on this idea, we propose a reasoning-based personalized image
preference assessment framework that follows a \textit{predict-then-assess}
paradigm: it first predicts a user's preference profile from reference images,
and then provides interpretable, multi-dimensional scores and assessments of
candidate images based on the predicted profile. To support this, we first
construct a large-scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-style personalized assessment
dataset annotated with diverse user preference profiles and high-quality
CoT-style reasoning, enabling explicit supervision of structured reasoning.
Next, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised
fine-tuning phase to empower the model with structured reasoning capabilities,
followed by reinforcement learning to incentivize the model to explore more
reasonable assessment paths and enhance generalization. Furthermore, we propose
a similarity-aware prediction reward to encourage better prediction of the
user's preference profile, which facilitates more reasonable assessments
exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they often suffer from overthinking, producing excessively
long chain-of-thought (CoT) traces that increase inference cost and may degrade
accuracy. Our analysis reveals a clear anti-correlation between reasoning
length and accuracy, where across multiple stochastic decodes, the short
reasoning paths consistently achieve the highest correctness, while longer ones
accumulate errors and repetitions. These short optimal reasoning paths can be
found ideally through full enumeration of the reasoning space. However, the
tree-structured reasoning space grows exponentially with sequence length,
rendering exhaustive exploration infeasible. To address this, we propose DTS, a
model-agnostic decoding framework that sketches the reasoning space by
selectively branching at high-entropy tokens and applies early stopping to
select the shortest completed reasoning path. This approach approximates the
optimal solution that enhances both efficiency and accuracy, without requiring
additional training or supervision. Experiments on AIME2024 and AIME2025
datasets with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and 1.5B show that DTS improves
accuracy by up to 8%, reduces average reasoning length by 23%, and decreases
repetition frequency by 12%, demonstrating DTS's ability for scalable and
efficient LRM reasoning.

Abstract: Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making
effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging.
Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks,
existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled
data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject
Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify
root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a
Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language
Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated
network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the
framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution
planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues
and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component
of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation
plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small
Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce
domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across
both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.

Abstract: Most planners ground numeric planning tasks, given in a first-order-like
language, into a ground task representation. However, this can lead to an
exponential blowup in task representation size, which occurs in practice for
hard-to-ground tasks. We extend a state-of-the-art lifted successor generator
for classical planning to support numeric precondition applicability. The
method enumerates maximum cliques in a substitution consistency graph. Each
maximum clique represents a substitution for the variables of the action
schema, yielding a ground action. We augment this graph with numeric action
preconditions and prove the successor generator is exact under formally
specified conditions. When the conditions fail, our generator may list
inapplicable ground actions; a final applicability check filters these without
affecting completeness. However, this cannot happen in 23 of 25 benchmark
domains, and it occurs only in 1 domain. To the authors' knowledge, no other
lifted successor generator supports numeric action preconditions. This enables
future research on lifted planning for a very rich planning fragment.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) post-trained with Reinforcement Learning
(RL) show impressive general reasoning, their evaluation is often confined to
language-dominant tasks (e.g., math). This raises a critical question: can RL
post-training truly extend the inherent capability boundary of a base VLM,
particularly for visual-centric spatial tasks where it initially fails? To
investigate this, we introduce Ariadne, a framework utilizing synthetic mazes
for multi-step spatial reasoning where task difficulty (e.g., path length,
turns) is precisely controlled. We leverage this controllable environment to
train VLMs using Reinforcement Learning with Verified Rewards (RLVR) in a
difficulty-aware curriculum. Surprisingly, post-RLVR training, the VLM achieves
over 50% accuracy on a problem set where the base model scored 0%,
demonstrating that our approach expands the model's initial capability
boundary. To assess real-world viability, we evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization on practical benchmarks. Despite training only on synthetic maze
samples, Ariadne achieves significant zero-shot improvements, averaging 16% on
MapBench (e.g., museum navigation) and 24% on ReasonMap (subway transfer
tasks). These results confirm that our method not only broadens the model's
fundamental limits but also enhances its generalization to real-world spatial
reasoning. We acknowledge our study is limited to the post-training phase,
given the opaqueness of pre-training data, and hope our research motivates
further work on specialized, capability-extending alignment.

Abstract: Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with
external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database,
and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles
into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps,
and adapt on the fly.
  This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks
introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric
perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of
orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and
repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level
performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five
representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow,
Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and
demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We
observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total
latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors -
coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main
memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to
44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling
insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching
(CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and
heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to
improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve
up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing
benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

Abstract: This study examines the trade-offs of increasing sampled reasoning paths in
self-consistency for modern large language models (LLMs). Earlier research with
older models showed that combining multiple reasoning chains improves results
before reaching a plateau. Using Gemini 2.5 models on HotpotQA and Math-500, we
revisit those claims under current model conditions. Each configuration pooled
outputs from varying sampled reasoning paths and compared them to a single
chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline. Larger models exhibited a more stable and
consistent improvement curve. The results confirm that performance gains taper
off after moderate sampling, aligning with past findings. This plateau suggests
diminishing returns driven by overlap among reasoning paths. Self-consistency
remains useful, but high-sample configurations offer little benefit relative to
their computational cost.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly required to
operate autonomously in dynamic, uncertain, and continuously changing
environments. However, most existing AI models rely on predefined objectives,
static training data, and externally supplied feedback, which restrict their
ability to adapt, reflect, and improve independently. In this paper, we propose
the Active Thinking Model (ATM)- a unified cognitive framework that integrates
goal reasoning, dynamic task generation, and self-reflective learning into an
adaptive architecture. Unlike conventional systems that passively execute fixed
procedures, ATM actively evaluates its performance through logical reasoning
and environmental indicators, reuses effective methods to solve new problems,
and generates novel strategies for unseen situations via a continuous
self-improvement loop. A mathematically grounded theoretical analysis
demonstrates that ATM can autonomously evolve from suboptimal to optimal
behavior without external supervision and maintain bounded tracking regret
under changing environmental conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive
deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales
with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n
times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule,
integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum
mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition
algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In
contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp
double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an
accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation.
This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To
explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that
captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and
internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively
reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between
attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to
empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters
that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for
each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the
limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models.

Abstract: Structured electronic health records (EHR) are essential for clinical
prediction. While count-based learners continue to perform strongly on such
data, no benchmarking has directly compared them against more recent
mixture-of-agents LLM pipelines, which have been reported to outperform single
LLMs in various NLP tasks. In this study, we evaluated three categories of
methodologies for EHR prediction using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models
built from ontology roll-ups with two time bins, based on LightGBM and the
tabular foundation model TabPFN; a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR);
and a mixture-of-agents pipeline that converts tabular histories to
natural-language summaries followed by a text classifier. We assessed eight
outcomes using the EHRSHOT dataset. Across the eight evaluation tasks,
head-to-head wins were largely split between the count-based and the
mixture-of-agents methods. Given their simplicity and interpretability,
count-based models remain a strong candidate for structured EHR benchmarking.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Predicting public transit incident duration from unstructured text alerts is
a critical but challenging task. Addressing the domain sparsity of transit
operations with standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is difficult, as the task
involves noisy, continuous labels and lacks reliable expert demonstrations for
reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) excels
at tasks with binary correctness, like mathematics, its applicability to noisy,
continuous forecasting is an open question. This work, to our knowledge, is the
first to bridge the gap between RLVR LLM training with the critical, real-world
forecasting challenges in public transit operations. We adapt RLVR to this task
by introducing a tolerance-based, shaped reward function that grants partial
credit within a continuous error margin, rather than demanding a single correct
answer. We systematically evaluate this framework on a curated dataset of NYC
MTA service alerts. Our findings show that general-purpose, instruction-tuned
LLMs significantly outperform specialized math-reasoning models, which struggle
with the ambiguous, real-world text. We empirically demonstrate that the binary
reward is unstable and degrades performance, whereas our shaped reward design
is critical and allows our model to dominate on the most challenging metrics.
While classical regressors are superior at minimizing overall MAE or MSE, our
RLVR approach achieved a 35\% relative improvement in 5-minute accuracy (Acc@5)
over the strongest baseline. This demonstrates that RLVR can be successfully
adapted to real-world, noisy forecasting, but requires a verifier design that
reflects the continuous nature of the problem.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow in capability, do they develop
self-awareness as an emergent behavior? And if so, can we measure it? We
introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for
measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the "Guess
2/3 of Average" game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across
4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against
other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize
self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on
opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The
majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness,
while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware
models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with
self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges: Self > Other AIs >
Humans, with large AI attribution effects and moderate self-preferencing. These
findings reveal that self-awareness is an emergent capability of advanced LLMs,
and that self-aware models systematically perceive themselves as more rational
than humans. This has implications for AI alignment, human-AI collaboration,
and understanding AI beliefs about human capabilities.

Abstract: Effective modeling of how human travelers learn and adjust their travel
behavior from interacting with transportation systems is critical for system
assessment and planning. However, this task is also difficult due to the
complex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent
research has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task.
Building on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables
continuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on
learning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach
involves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a
learnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure
behavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the
reasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these
traveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track
and align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce
realistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day
route choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and
aggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method
moves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying
learning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization.
Overall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and
behaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation
that can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis.

Abstract: Recurrent exacerbations remain a common yet preventable outcome for many
children with asthma. Machine learning (ML) algorithms using electronic medical
records (EMR) could allow accurate identification of children at risk for
exacerbations and facilitate referral for preventative comprehensive care to
avoid this morbidity. We developed ML algorithms to predict repeat severe
exacerbations (i.e. asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits or future
hospital admissions) for children with a prior asthma ED visit at a tertiary
care children's hospital.
  Retrospective pre-COVID19 (Feb 2017 - Feb 2019, N=2716) Epic EMR data from
the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) linked with environmental
pollutant exposure and neighbourhood marginalization information was used to
train various ML models. We used boosted trees (LGBM, XGB) and 3 open-source
large language model (LLM) approaches (DistilGPT2, Llama 3.2 1B and
Llama-8b-UltraMedical). Models were tuned and calibrated then validated in a
second retrospective post-COVID19 dataset (Jul 2022 - Apr 2023, N=1237) from
CHEO. Models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) and F1 scores,
with SHAP values used to determine the most predictive features.
  The LGBM ML model performed best with the most predictive features in the
final AIRE-KIDS_ED model including prior asthma ED visit, the Canadian triage
acuity scale, medical complexity, food allergy, prior ED visits for non-asthma
respiratory diagnoses, and age for an AUC of 0.712, and F1 score of 0.51. This
is a nontrivial improvement over the current decision rule which has F1=0.334.
While the most predictive features in the AIRE-KIDS_HOSP model included medical
complexity, prior asthma ED visit, average wait time in the ED, the pediatric
respiratory assessment measure score at triage and food allergy.

Abstract: Transformers have become the dominant architecture for natural language
processing. Part of their success is owed to a remarkable capability known as
in-context learning (ICL): they can acquire and apply novel associations solely
from their input context, without any updates to their weights. In this work,
we study the emergence of induction heads, a previously identified mechanism in
two-layer transformers that is particularly important for in-context learning.
We uncover a relatively simple and interpretable structure of the weight
matrices implementing the induction head. We theoretically explain the origin
of this structure using a minimal ICL task formulation and a modified
transformer architecture. We give a formal proof that the training dynamics
remain constrained to a 19-dimensional subspace of the parameter space.
Empirically, we validate this constraint while observing that only 3 dimensions
account for the emergence of an induction head. By further studying the
training dynamics inside this 3-dimensional subspace, we find that the time
until the emergence of an induction head follows a tight asymptotic bound that
is quadratic in the input context length.

Abstract: Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet
extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a
persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine
learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting
their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge
Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large
language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer
staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses
an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from
unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The
second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG),
employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant
guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and
avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply
broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer
pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in
identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches
on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG
when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG
achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both
methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules
explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation
methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging
with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited
annotated data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities,
their reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to inaccuracies. Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge,
but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to
inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect
answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods,
and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To
address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented
Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while
maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that
first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to
efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length.
Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority
voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In
particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the
key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively
perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus,
we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing
the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting.
Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance
across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation
and image captioning.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of a single agent in task decomposition
and collaboration during complex task execution, and proposes a multi-agent
architecture for modular task decomposition and dynamic collaboration based on
large language models. The method first converts natural language task
descriptions into unified semantic representations through a large language
model. On this basis, a modular decomposition mechanism is introduced to break
down the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks. Then, dynamic
scheduling and routing mechanisms enable reasonable division of labor and
realtime collaboration among agents, allowing the system to adjust strategies
continuously according to environmental feedback, thus maintaining efficiency
and stability in complex tasks. Furthermore, a constraint parsing and global
consistency mechanism is designed to ensure coherent connections between
sub-tasks and balanced workload, preventing performance degradation caused by
redundant communication or uneven resource allocation. The experiments validate
the architecture across multiple dimensions, including task success rate,
decomposition efficiency, sub-task coverage, and collaboration balance. The
results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both
overall performance and robustness, achieving a better balance between task
complexity and communication overhead. In conclusion, this study demonstrates
the effectiveness and feasibility of language-driven task decomposition and
dynamic collaboration in multi-agent systems, providing a systematic solution
for task execution in complex environments.

Abstract: Adaptive reasoning is essential for aligning the computational effort of
large language models (LLMs) with the intrinsic difficulty of problems. Current
chain-of-thought methods boost reasoning ability but indiscriminately generate
long explanations, leading to evident inefficiency. However, existing
reinforcement learning approaches to adaptive thinking remain unstable and
heavily reward-dependent. Here we propose \textbf{DART}, a supervised
\textbf{D}ifficulty-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{T}runcation
framework that adjusts thinking length according to problem difficulty. By
distilling concise reasoning patterns from stronger models, interpolating them
into a continuum of reasoning styles, and curating optimal training data that
balances correctness and compactness, DART learns when to ``stop thinking''.
Across multiple mathematical benchmarks, experimental results demonstrate its
remarkable efficiency while preserving or improving accuracy, achieving a
significant 81.2\% reasoning truncation (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B on GSM8K
dataset) with 5.33$\times$ computational acceleration. DART provides a stable
and general paradigm for efficient reasoning, advancing the development of
adaptive intelligence in LLMs.

Abstract: Detecting student misconceptions in open-ended responses is a longstanding
challenge, demanding semantic precision and logical reasoning. We propose
MiRAGE - Misconception Detection with Retrieval-Guided Multi-Stage Reasoning
and Ensemble Fusion, a novel framework for automated misconception detection in
mathematics. MiRAGE operates in three stages: (1) a Retrieval module narrows a
large candidate pool to a semantically relevant subset; (2) a Reasoning module
employs chain-of-thought generation to expose logical inconsistencies in
student solutions; and (3) a Reranking module refines predictions by aligning
them with the reasoning. These components are unified through an
ensemble-fusion strategy that enhances robustness and interpretability. On
mathematics datasets, MiRAGE achieves Mean Average Precision scores of
0.82/0.92/0.93 at levels 1/3/5, consistently outperforming individual modules.
By coupling retrieval guidance with multi-stage reasoning, MiRAGE reduces
dependence on large-scale language models while delivering a scalable and
effective solution for educational assessment.

Abstract: Compilers, while essential, are notoriously complex systems that demand
prohibitively expensive human expertise to develop and maintain. The recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling new paradigm:
Neural Compilation, which could potentially simplify compiler development for
new architectures and facilitate the discovery of innovative optimization
techniques. However, several critical obstacles impede its practical adoption.
Firstly, a significant lack of dedicated benchmarks and robust evaluation
methodologies hinders objective assessment and tracking of progress in the
field. Secondly, systematically enhancing the reliability and performance of
LLM-generated assembly remains a critical challenge. Addressing these
challenges, this paper introduces NeuComBack, a novel benchmark dataset
specifically designed for IR-to-assembly compilation. Leveraging this dataset,
we first define a foundational Neural Compilation workflow and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of recent frontier LLMs on Neural
Compilation, establishing new performance baselines. We further propose a
self-evolving prompt optimization method that enables LLMs to iteratively
evolve their internal prompt strategies by extracting insights from prior
self-debugging traces, thereby enhancing their neural compilation capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the
functional correctness and the performance of LLM-generated assembly code.
Compared to baseline prompts, the functional correctness rates improved from
44% to 64% on x86_64 and from 36% to 58% on aarch64, respectively. More
significantly, among the 16 correctly generated x86_64 programs using our
method, 14 (87.5%) surpassed clang-O3 performance.

Abstract: Recently, fault diagnosis methods for marine machinery systems based on deep
learning models have attracted considerable attention in the shipping industry.
Most existing studies assume fault classes are consistent and known between the
training and test datasets, and these methods perform well under controlled
environment. In practice, however, previously unseen or unknown fault types
(i.e., out-of-distribution or open-set observations not present during
training) can occur, causing such methods to fail and posing a significant
challenge to their widespread industrial deployment. To address this challenge,
this paper proposes a semi-supervised open-set fault diagnosis (SOFD) framework
that enhances and extends the applicability of deep learning models in open-set
fault diagnosis scenarios. The framework includes a reliability subset
construction process, which uses a multi-layer fusion feature representation
extracted by a supervised feature learning model to select an unlabeled test
subset. The labeled training set and pseudo-labeled test subset are then fed
into a semi-supervised diagnosis model to learn discriminative features for
each class, enabling accurate classification of known faults and effective
detection of unknown samples. Experimental results on a public maritime
benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
SOFD framework.

Abstract: Feature attribution methods help make machine learning-based inference
explainable by determining how much one or several features have contributed to
a model's output. A particularly popular attribution method is based on the
Shapley value from cooperative game theory, a measure that guarantees the
satisfaction of several desirable principles, assuming deterministic inference.
We apply the Shapley value to feature attribution in large language model
(LLM)-based decision support systems, where inference is, by design, stochastic
(non-deterministic). We then demonstrate when we can and cannot guarantee
Shapley value principle satisfaction across different implementation variants
applied to LLM-based decision support, and analyze how the stochastic nature of
LLMs affects these guarantees. We also highlight trade-offs between explainable
inference speed, agreement with exact Shapley value attributions, and principle
attainment.

Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of tool conditions is critical for intelligent
manufacturing systems, where unplanned tool failures can lead to quality
degradation and production downtime. In modern industrial environments,
predictive maintenance is increasingly implemented as an intelligent service
that integrates sensing, analysis, and decision support across production
processes. To meet the demand for reliable and service-oriented operation, we
present OmniFuser, a multimodal learning framework for predictive maintenance
of milling tools that leverages both visual and sensor data. It performs
parallel feature extraction from high-resolution tool images and cutting-force
signals, capturing complementary spatiotemporal patterns across modalities. To
effectively integrate heterogeneous features, OmniFuser employs a
contamination-free cross-modal fusion mechanism that disentangles shared and
modality-specific components, allowing for efficient cross-modal interaction.
Furthermore, a recursive refinement pathway functions as an anchor mechanism,
consistently retaining residual information to stabilize fusion dynamics. The
learned representations can be encapsulated as reusable maintenance service
modules, supporting both tool-state classification (e.g., Sharp, Used, Dulled)
and multi-step force signal forecasting. Experiments on real-world milling
datasets demonstrate that OmniFuser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, providing a dependable foundation for building intelligent
industrial maintenance services.

Abstract: Evaluating platform-level interventions in search-based two-sided
marketplaces is fundamentally challenged by systemic effects such as spillovers
and network interference. While widely used for causal inference, the PSM
(Propensity Score Matching) - DID (Difference-in-Differences) framework remains
susceptible to selection bias and cross-unit interference from unaccounted
spillovers. In this paper, we introduced Competitive Isolation PSM-DID, a novel
causal framework that integrates propensity score matching with competitive
isolation to enable platform-level effect measurement (e.g., order volume, GMV)
instead of item-level metrics in search systems.
  Our approach provides theoretically guaranteed unbiased estimation under
mutual exclusion conditions, with an open dataset released to support
reproducible research on marketplace interference (github.com/xxxx). Extensive
experiments demonstrate significant reductions in interference effects and
estimation variance compared to baseline methods. Successful deployment in a
large-scale marketplace confirms the framework's practical utility for
platform-level causal inference.

Abstract: The cognitive processes of the hypnotized mind and the computational
operations of large language models (LLMs) share deep functional parallels.
Both systems generate sophisticated, contextually appropriate behavior through
automatic pattern-completion mechanisms operating with limited or unreliable
executive oversight. This review examines this convergence across three
principles: automaticity, in which responses emerge from associative rather
than deliberative processes; suppressed monitoring, leading to errors such as
confabulation in hypnosis and hallucination in LLMs; and heightened contextual
dependency, where immediate cues (for example, the suggestion of a therapist or
the prompt of the user) override stable knowledge.
  These mechanisms reveal an observer-relative meaning gap: both systems
produce coherent but ungrounded outputs that require an external interpreter to
supply meaning. Hypnosis and LLMs also exemplify functional agency - the
capacity for complex, goal-directed, context-sensitive behavior - without
subjective agency, the conscious awareness of intention and ownership that
defines human action. This distinction clarifies how purposive behavior can
emerge without self-reflective consciousness, governed instead by structural
and contextual dynamics. Finally, both domains illuminate the phenomenon of
scheming: automatic, goal-directed pattern generation that unfolds without
reflective awareness. Hypnosis provides an experimental model for understanding
how intention can become dissociated from conscious deliberation, offering
insights into the hidden motivational dynamics of artificial systems.
Recognizing these parallels suggests that the future of reliable AI lies in
hybrid architectures that integrate generative fluency with mechanisms of
executive monitoring, an approach inspired by the complex, self-regulating
architecture of the human mind.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Identifying the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for improving their safety by addressing inherent weaknesses. Jailbreaks, in
which adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central
role in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors.
Recent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack
prompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary
attack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted
scoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring
outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign),
a meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and
scoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are
refined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template.
In the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score,
gradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This
co-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and
more calibrated scoring signals. Evaluations on AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors
demonstrate that AMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 88.0%
ASR on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100.0% ASR on Claude-4-Sonnet, outperforming
existing baselines by substantial margins.

Abstract: Cluster DAGs (C-DAGs) provide an abstraction of causal graphs in which nodes
represent clusters of variables, and edges encode both cluster-level causal
relationships and dependencies arisen from unobserved confounding. C-DAGs
define an equivalence class of acyclic causal graphs that agree on
cluster-level relationships, enabling causal reasoning at a higher level of
abstraction. However, when the chosen clustering induces cycles in the
resulting C-DAG, the partition is deemed inadmissible under conventional C-DAG
semantics. In this work, we extend the C-DAG framework to support arbitrary
variable clusterings by relaxing the partition admissibility constraint,
thereby allowing cyclic C-DAG representations. We extend the notions of
d-separation and causal calculus to this setting, significantly broadening the
scope of causal reasoning across clusters and enabling the application of
C-DAGs in previously intractable scenarios. Our calculus is both sound and
atomically complete with respect to the do-calculus: all valid interventional
queries at the cluster level can be derived using our rules, each corresponding
to a primitive do-calculus step.

Abstract: This study explores the interference in temporal processing within a
dual-task paradigm from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. In this
context, the dual-task setup is implemented as a simplified version of the
Overcooked environment with two variations, single task (T) and dual task
(T+N). Both variations involve an embedded time production task, but the dual
task (T+N) additionally involves a concurrent number comparison task. Two deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) agents were separately trained for each of these
tasks. These agents exhibited emergent behavior consistent with human timing
research. Specifically, the dual task (T+N) agent exhibited significant
overproduction of time relative to its single task (T) counterpart. This result
was consistent across four target durations. Preliminary analysis of neural
dynamics in the agents' LSTM layers did not reveal any clear evidence of a
dedicated or intrinsic timer. Hence, further investigation is needed to better
understand the underlying time-keeping mechanisms of the agents and to provide
insights into the observed behavioral patterns. This study is a small step
towards exploring parallels between emergent DRL behavior and behavior observed
in biological systems in order to facilitate a better understanding of both.

Abstract: Explanations for AI models in high-stakes domains like medicine often lack
verifiability, which can hinder trust. To address this, we propose an
interactive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of
actions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual
evidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using
reinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and
generalizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process
significantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\%
compared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the
agent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the
visual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation
in its performance ($\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is
integral to its decision-making process. Our work provides a practical
framework for building AI systems with verifiable and faithful reasoning
capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis has received significant attention across
diverse research domains. Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing
approaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of
noise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal
interactions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in
discarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal
redundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
Double Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified
compact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank
Renyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse
noise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as
compared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises
two key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of
individual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and
discarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative
ability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck
fusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that
effectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing
inter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
CH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method. The model
achieves 47.4% accuracy under the Acc-7 metric on CMU-MOSI and 81.63% F1-score
on CH-SIMS, outperforming the second-best baseline by 1.19%. Under noise, it
shows only 0.36% and 0.29% performance degradation on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI
respectively.

Abstract: Global healthcare systems face critical challenges from increasing patient
volumes and limited consultation times, with primary care visits averaging
under 5 minutes in many countries. While pre-consultation processes
encompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions,
they remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management
challenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive
inquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an
eight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes
pre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present
Illness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief
Complaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13
domain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health
records from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models
(GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for
primary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification,
with task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus
93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians
averaged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and
4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within
12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic
architecture maintained high performance across different foundation models
while preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the
potential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and
quality in clinical settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have exhibited strong problem-solving
competence across domains like research and coding. Yet, it remains
underexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems
that require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous
tool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on
task planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to
ensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of
LLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling.
TPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a
tool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In
particular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map
navigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a
basic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency.
The empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate
that most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in
scheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate
of 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from
significantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel
tool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering
reinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling
efficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on
Qwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in
task completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples. Our code is

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a multimodal analysis pipeline that leverages
large foundation models in vision and language to analyze corporate social
media content, with a focus on sustainability-related communication. Addressing
the challenges of evolving, multimodal, and often ambiguous corporate messaging
on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), we employ an ensemble of large
language models (LLMs) to annotate a large corpus of corporate tweets on their
topical alignment with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This
approach avoids the need for costly, task-specific annotations and explores the
potential of such models as ad-hoc annotators for social media data that can
efficiently capture both explicit and implicit references to sustainability
themes in a scalable manner. Complementing this textual analysis, we utilize
vision-language models (VLMs), within a visual understanding framework that
uses semantic clusters to uncover patterns in visual sustainability
communication. This integrated approach reveals sectoral differences in SDG
engagement, temporal trends, and associations between corporate messaging,
environmental, social, governance (ESG) risks, and consumer engagement. Our
methods-automatic label generation and semantic visual clustering-are broadly
applicable to other domains and offer a flexible framework for large-scale
social media analysis.

Abstract: Large language models suffer from knowledge staleness and lack of
interpretability due to implicit knowledge storage across entangled network
parameters, preventing targeted updates and reasoning transparency. We propose
ExplicitLM, a novel architecture featuring a million-scale external memory bank
storing human-readable knowledge as token sequences, enabling direct inspection
and modification. We design a differentiable two-stage retrieval mechanism with
efficient coarse-grained filtering via product key decomposition (reducing
complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot |I|)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N} \cdot
|I|)$) and fine-grained Gumbel-Softmax matching for end-to-end training.
Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we partition knowledge into frozen
explicit facts (20%) and learnable implicit patterns (80%), maintained through
Exponential Moving Average updates for stability. ExplicitLM achieves up to
43.67% improvement on knowledge-intensive tasks versus standard Transformers,
with 3.62$\times$ gains in low-data regimes (10k samples). Analysis shows
strong correlations between memory retrieval and performance, with correct
predictions achieving 49% higher hit rates. Unlike RAG systems with frozen
retrieval, our jointly optimized architecture demonstrates that interpretable,
updatable models can maintain competitive performance while providing
unprecedented knowledge transparency.

Abstract: Global food trade plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and
maintaining supply chain stability. However, its network structure evolves
dynamically under the influence of geopolitical, economic, and environmental
factors, making it challenging to model and predict future trade links.
Effectively capturing temporal patterns in food trade networks is therefore
essential for improving the accuracy and robustness of link prediction. This
study introduces IVGAE-TAMA-BO, a novel dynamic graph neural network designed
to model evolving trade structures and predict future links in global food
trade networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply
dynamic graph neural networks to this domain, significantly enhancing
predictive performance. Building upon the original IVGAE framework, the
proposed model incorporates a Trade-Aware Momentum Aggregator (TAMA) to capture
the temporal evolution of trade networks, jointly modeling short-term
fluctuations and long-term structural dependencies. A momentum-based structural
memory mechanism further improves predictive stability and performance. In
addition, Bayesian optimization is used to automatically tune key
hyperparameters, enhancing generalization across diverse trade scenarios.
Extensive experiments on five crop-specific datasets demonstrate that
IVGAE-TAMA substantially outperforms the static IVGAE and other dynamic
baselines by effectively modeling temporal dependencies, while Bayesian
optimization further boosts performance in IVGAE-TAMA-BO. These results
highlight the proposed framework as a robust and scalable solution for
structural prediction in global trade networks, with strong potential for
applications in food security monitoring and policy decision support.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence permeates judicial forensics, ensuring the
veracity and traceability of legal question answering (QA) has become critical.
Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking
misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases
struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present
a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver
reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes
retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant
evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate
candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked
answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being
written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and
provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\_QA dataset show that our hybrid
approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla
RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm
the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling,
and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably
reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance,
advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial
scenarios.

Abstract: LLM agents excel in compact environments requiring deep reasoning but remain
brittle when operating in broader, more complex contexts that demand robustness
across diverse tools and schemas. Building bespoke environments for training is
heavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs
can simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed
data or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks:
Simia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets
into diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a
framework that enables RL training without real environment implementations
through LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent
improvements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching
o4-mini on $\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable
agent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle
implementations with flexible LLM-based simulation.
