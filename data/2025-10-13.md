### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They benchmark CNNs, zero-shot multimodal LLMs, and fine-tuned multimodal LLMs for detecting artificial text overlays in images, finding that lightly fine-tuned LLMs (with <1k images) can improve accuracy by up to 36% and match/surpass CNN baselines, with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs’ out-of-the-box visual capabilities are underused for specialized tasks; there is a need for data-efficient methods that bridge language and vision for precise object/region detection in low-resource settings.

Method: Conduct a systematic comparison across three regimes: (1) fine-tuned CNNs (e.g., ResNet/YOLO), (2) zero-shot pre-trained multimodal LLMs, and (3) fine-tuned multimodal LLMs. Fine-tune LLMs on fewer than 1,000 labeled images for artificial text overlay detection, leveraging language-guided prompts and contextual reasoning, and evaluate accuracy against CNN baselines.

Result: Fine-tuned multimodal LLMs achieve up to 36% absolute accuracy gains over their zero-shot performance and reach or exceed CNN baselines that typically require far more data.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs are adaptable and data-efficient for specialized visual detection tasks when minimally fine-tuned, providing a practical path for low-resource applications; code is released to enable reuse and extensions.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [2] [Reproducible Evaluation of Data Augmentation and Loss Functions for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08617)
*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reproducible U-Net brain tumor MRI segmentation study showing that tuning focal loss and using simple augmentations yields competitive precision (~90%), providing an open baseline for future work on loss/augmentation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation is clinically important but suffers from class imbalance and poor generalization; the field also lacks transparent, reproducible baselines to assess loss functions and augmentation choices.

Method: Train U-Net on a public MRI dataset with focal loss, systematically tune focal-loss parameters, and test three basic data augmentations (horizontal flip, rotation, scaling); evaluate segmentation performance and release code/results for reproducibility.

Result: U-Net with focal loss achieved 90% precision, comparable to state-of-the-art, with reported analysis of augmentation impact (details not quantified in the abstract).

Conclusion: A transparent, reproducible baseline is established; focal loss with simple augmentations can be competitive, guiding future research on augmentation strategies and loss function design for brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adjusting the initial noise in text-to-image diffusion models can trigger earlier escape from memorization “attraction basins,” enabling earlier CFG and thereby reducing training-data memorization without sacrificing prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often memorize and reproduce training images, raising privacy and copyright risks. Prior mitigation defers CFG until the denoising path exits a memorization basin, but this hurts prompt-image alignment. A method is needed to escape earlier so CFG can be applied sooner without losing alignment.

Method: Empirically show that escape time from the memorization basin depends strongly on the initial noise sample. Propose two strategies that modify the initial noise: (1) a collective approach that biases noise choices toward seeds that typically escape early, and (2) an individual approach that adapts or searches per prompt/sample for noise seeds that lead to earlier escape. These enable applying CFG earlier in the trajectory.

Result: Both noise-adjustment strategies substantially reduce memorization while maintaining good image-text alignment by allowing earlier CFG application after exiting the basin.

Conclusion: Initial noise selection/tuning is a simple, effective lever for mitigating memorization in text-to-image diffusion without degrading alignment, suggesting a practical add-on to existing generation pipelines.

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study of AI image generators (DALL-E 3, Ideogram) shows they reproduce traditional gender stereotypes in occupational images; calls for mitigation strategies to ensure diverse representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research emphasized creation workflows and image quality, neglecting representational bias. As AI visuals proliferate in media and workplaces, unchecked gender stereotyping (and related aspects like age and emotion portrayal) risks entrenching harmful norms.

Method: Generated 750+ occupation-related images using DALL-E 3 and Ideogram; conducted thematic analysis to assess representation patterns, including consideration of ageing and emotional depiction; compared bias strength across tools.

Result: Both generators reinforced traditional gender stereotypes in occupational portrayals, though the extent varied by tool. Findings indicate narrow representations and potential bias related to visible gender; ageing/emotion dimensions were examined but specifics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: AI visualisation tools can amplify stereotypical portrayals unless guided. The authors recommend practical steps for practitioners, individuals, and researchers to broaden representation when prompting and deploying images with visible genders.

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They add a dynamic Mixture‑of‑Experts router with scale‑aware thresholding to Visual Autoregressive Models, cutting compute and latency while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR models repeatedly invoke Transformers at higher resolutions, creating redundant computation; the authors seek to reduce this overhead without sacrificing generation quality or retraining costs.

Method: Integrate a dynamic MoE router into VAR and apply scale‑aware thresholding that selects experts per token based on its complexity and the current resolution, enabling a compute–quality trade‑off and requiring no additional training.

Result: ~20% fewer FLOPs and ~11% faster inference while matching the dense baseline’s image quality.

Conclusion: Dynamic, thresholded expert routing in VAR provides a practical way to save compute and speed up inference without degrading quality, offering tunable efficiency–quality trade‑offs without retraining.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose an unsupervised LiDAR OOD detector that isolates epistemic (model) uncertainty via a hierarchical Bayesian GMM in deep feature space, avoiding entropy-based conflation with aleatoric uncertainty and achieving markedly better OOD metrics on SemanticKITTI without extra data or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised OOD detection methods for LiDAR often use predictive entropy, which mixes epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties and falsely flags ambiguous in-distribution regions as OOD. They aim to separate these uncertainties to improve reliability while avoiding the need for auxiliary OOD datasets or extra training stages.

Method: Model deep feature-space distributions with a Gaussian Mixture Model whose parameters are given a hierarchical Bayesian prior; compute epistemic uncertainty from the posterior over GMM parameters to detect OOD. This removes reliance on ensembles/MC sampling of network weights and avoids auxiliary OOD data or additional training.

Result: On SemanticKITTI, the method outperforms uncertainty-based baselines using predictive entropy, with +18% AUROC, +22% AUPRC, and a 36% FPR95 reduction (76%→40%).

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling epistemic uncertainty via hierarchical Bayesian GMMs in feature space improves unsupervised OOD detection for LiDAR semantic segmentation, delivering strong gains over entropy-based approaches without extra data or training overhead.

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They introduce Hi-OSCAR, a hierarchical open-set classifier for Human Activity Recognition that recognizes known activities with state-of-the-art accuracy, rejects unseen activities, and localizes unknowns to the closest node in an activity hierarchy; they also release a new 19-activity dataset (NFI_FARED).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world activity space is much broader than any labeled training set, so HAR systems encounter unseen activities that degrade reliability. Moreover, activities exhibit varying degrees of similarity and can be organized hierarchically. A method is needed that both handles unknowns and exploits class structure.

Method: Organize activity classes into a hierarchical taxonomy and propose Hi-OSCAR, a hierarchical open-set classifier. It performs standard recognition for known classes while detecting unknowns and mapping them to the nearest internal node in the hierarchy, offering more informative outcomes than binary known/unknown decisions.

Result: Hi-OSCAR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on known activities while simultaneously rejecting previously unseen ones and providing hierarchical localization for unknown classes. They also introduce and release NFI_FARED, a public multi-subject dataset with 19 activities spanning daily living, commuting, and rapid movements.

Conclusion: A hierarchical open-set approach improves HAR robustness and interpretability by addressing unseen activities and leveraging class structure; the new dataset supports further research in open-set HAR.

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose an unsupervised S‑transform–based detector to separate true HFOs (80–500 Hz) from spikes, background, and artifacts, achieving ~98% precision/97% sensitivity on controlled data and showing stronger correlation with postsurgical outcomes; removing fast-ripple HFOs aligns with seizure freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HFOs are promising biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone, but manual identification is slow, subjective, and impractical for clinical scale. There is a need for robust, automated detection that can distinguish HFOs from confounds and demonstrate clinical relevance.

Method: Extract time–frequency features via the S‑transform, then apply unsupervised clustering to categorize candidate events into HFOs versus spikes/background/artifacts across ripple and fast-ripple bands (80–500 Hz). Validate on controlled datasets and on intracranial EEG from epilepsy patients; compare with existing detectors and relate detected HFO distributions to resection and outcomes.

Result: On controlled data: sensitivity 97.67%, precision 98.57%, F1 97.78%. In patients: higher alignment with surgical outcomes than existing methods, with a reported 0.73 ratio between HFO rates in resected versus nonresected contacts; removal of fast-ripple HFOs associated with seizure freedom, residual HFOs with recurrence.

Conclusion: Unsupervised, S‑transform–based HFO detection is accurate on controlled data and clinically informative, reinforcing HFOs—especially fast ripples—as biomarkers of epileptogenic tissue. The method could improve resection targeting and outcome prediction.

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [9] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They probe DINOv2 with a sparse autoencoder dictionary to test linear feature explanations, find task-specific concept use and structure that exceeds linear sparsity, and propose the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis: tokens are convex mixtures of archetypal concepts shaped by attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong downstream performance, it is unclear what DINOv2 “perceives.” The authors seek an interpretable account of its internal features that explains how different tasks (classification, segmentation, depth) draw on shared representations and whether linear-sparse explanations suffice.

Method: Adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis and operationalize it with a 32k-unit sparse autoencoder (SAE) dictionary trained on DINOv2 features. Analyze which dictionary concepts are recruited by downstream tasks, then study the geometry/statistics of learned concepts (sparsity, coherence, orthogonality, token manifolds). Synthesize insights to propose a new hypothesis (MRH) grounded in conceptual spaces and ViT attention as convex mixture summation; examine its empirical signatures.

Result: Functional specialization: classification leverages “Elsewhere” concepts implementing learned negations; segmentation uses boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation relies on three monocular depth cues aligned with visual neuroscience. Geometrically/statistically: representations are partly dense; the dictionary becomes more coherent and deviates from maximally orthogonal frames; tokens within an image lie on a low-dimensional, locally connected set even after removing position—indicating organization beyond linear sparsity.

Conclusion: Linear sparsity alone is insufficient. Tokens are better viewed as convex mixtures of archetypal concepts, consistent with conceptual spaces and ViT attention mechanics. The Minkowski Representation Hypothesis provides a refined framework and yields testable signatures for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE is an all-in-one, physics-guided, degradation-adaptive restoration framework for remote sensing images that converts implicit features into explicit decision signals, outperforming SOTA on haze, noise, blur, and low-light tasks while being more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing images suffer from diverse, heterogeneous degradations (atmosphere, sensors, conditions). Existing unified restorers rely on implicit features and overlook explicit degradation physics, limiting accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency.

Method: A two-stage cascaded architecture that identifies and routes degradations via explicit decision signals. Progressive degradation mining/exploitation uses a Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) for manifold-geometry cues and a Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) for spectral cues. Physics-aware expert modules process specific degradations, activated sparsely via temperature-controlled gating to reduce compute and maintain physics consistency.

Result: On three benchmarks (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, MDRS-Landsat), PhyDAE achieves superior performance across haze, noise, blur, and low-light restoration, with notable reductions in parameters and FLOPs versus mainstream methods, yielding strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: Explicit physics-guided, degradation-adaptive experts deliver better quality and efficiency for multi-degradation remote sensing restoration. The approach appears robust and practical for real-world use, balancing accuracy and compute; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

TL;DR: Hulu-Med is an open, medical vision-language model that unifies text, 2D/3D imaging, and video understanding, delivering state-of-the-art results across 30 benchmarks with efficient training and a transparent pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical AI struggles to integrate multimodal data (text, 2D/3D images, video). Existing generalist VLMs are hampered by opaque development, limited medical data, and rigid architectures, causing inefficiencies and missed diagnoses.

Method: A unified patch-based vision encoder paired with an LLM decoder, progressively trained on 16.7M samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video. Introduces medical-aware token reduction for efficiency, enabling 7B–32B variants trained with ~4k–40k GPU hours. Entire pipeline is open-sourced.

Result: Across 30 benchmarks, Hulu-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models and rivaling proprietary systems on VQA, report generation, and complex reasoning, including multilingual and rare-disease scenarios.

Conclusion: Transparent, high-performance medical VLMs are feasible. Hulu-Med provides an open, scalable foundation for accessible clinical AI across diverse modalities.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

### [12] [Thinking with Camera: A Unified Multimodal Model for Camera-Centric Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08673)
*Kang Liao,Size Wu,Zhonghua Wu,Linyi Jin,Chao Wang,Yikai Wang,Fei Wang,Wei Li,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin is a unified multimodal model that treats camera parameters as language to jointly do camera-centric understanding and viewpoint-conditioned generation, trained on 4M vision–language–camera triplets and outperforming specialized baselines on cross-view tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-centric understanding (reasoning about scenes from camera geometry) and camera-conditioned generation (synthesizing views) are siloed. Bridging them could enable richer spatial reasoning, controllable view synthesis, and instruction-following across viewpoints. Existing VLMs lack explicit camera grounding; generative models lack language reasoning. The work aims to close this modality and capability gap.

Method: Develop Puffin, which integrates a language regression head for camera-aware understanding and a diffusion-based generator for viewpoint-conditioned synthesis. Key idea: treat camera as language—encode camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps in a linguistic/semantic interface to align photographic terms with geometric cues. Train on Puffin-4M (4M image–text–camera triplets). Use both global camera parameters and per-pixel camera maps to enhance spatial fidelity. Apply instruction tuning for cross-view tasks.

Result: Puffin yields superior performance to specialized camera-centric models on both understanding and generation benchmarks. It demonstrates flexible, reliable spatial generation and cross-view generalization (e.g., spatial imagination, world exploration, photography guidance).

Conclusion: Modeling cameras as a first-class linguistic modality enables unified spatial reasoning and generation. With large-scale triplets and explicit camera representations, Puffin advances camera-aware multimodal intelligence and generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks. The authors plan to release code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

### [13] [Structured Output Regularization: a framework for few-shot transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08728)
*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Structured Output Regularization (SOR), which freezes internal network structures and adds sparse, regularized adaptation (group lasso + L1), yielding competitive few-shot medical imaging performance with minimal extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transfer learning (freeze base, add heads) is efficient but adapts poorly to domain-specific features and can overfit under very limited data.

Method: Introduce SOR: keep core components (e.g., convolutional filters/blocks) fixed and add lightweight parameters governed by group lasso and L1 penalties to induce structured and element-wise sparsity, enabling selective adaptation across network parts with minimal overhead; applicable to various architectures (e.g., DenseNet, EfficientNet).

Result: On three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks, SOR with DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 backbones achieves competitive results relative to established benchmarks.

Conclusion: SOR is a simple, broadly applicable, and parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that improves adaptation while mitigating overfitting in low-data settings, particularly in medical imaging.

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

### [14] [BEAR: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multimodal Language Models for Atomic Embodied Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08759)
*Yu Qi,Haibo Zhao,Ziyu Guo,Siyuan Ma,Ziyan Chen,Yaokun Han,Renrui Zhang,Zitiantao Lin,Shiji Xin,Yijian Huang,Kai Cheng,Peiheng Wang,Jiazheng Liu,Jiayi Zhang,Yizhe Zhu,Wenqing Wang,Yiran Qin,Xupeng Zhu,Haojie Huang,Lawson L. S. Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEAR is a comprehensive benchmark of atomic embodied capabilities for MLLMs and a corresponding agent (BEAR-Agent) that integrates pretrained vision modules, yielding notable gains and exposing persistent limitations across embodied domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of multimodal LLMs focus on narrow slices (e.g., planning or spatial reasoning) and lack a systematic, fine-grained assessment of the fundamental embodied abilities needed to perceive, understand, and act in the physical world.

Method: Introduce BEAR, a benchmark with 4,469 interleaved image–video–text items covering 14 domains in 6 categories, spanning low-level pointing, trajectory understanding, spatial reasoning, and high-level planning. Evaluate 20 representative MLLMs. Propose BEAR-Agent, a conversable multimodal agent that plugs in pretrained vision models to enhance perception, 3D understanding, and planning.

Result: Across domains, current MLLMs show persistent shortcomings on BEAR. BEAR-Agent substantially improves scores, with a 9.12% absolute and 17.5% relative gain reported on GPT-5, and improved performance transfers to embodied tasks in simulated environments.

Conclusion: BEAR offers a fine-grained, comprehensive measurement of embodied capabilities and shows that augmenting MLLMs with specialized vision modules and agent scaffolding can materially boost embodied reasoning and planning, with potential benefits for downstream embodied tasks.

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

### [15] [SAFER-AiD: Saccade-Assisted Foveal-peripheral vision Enhanced Reconstruction for Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08761)
*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Biologically inspired, plug‑and‑play preprocessing uses RL‑guided saccadic glimpses and foveal–peripheral reconstruction to suppress adversarial noise, improving robustness on ImageNet across classifiers and attacks without retraining and with much lower training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional defenses (e.g., adversarial training, augmentation) are compute‑intensive and task‑specific. Human vision shows inherent robustness, likely due to attention‑guided sparse sampling and predictive coding. The work tests whether mimicking these mechanisms can yield efficient, generalizable robustness.

Method: Introduce a defense pipeline modeling three biological mechanisms: foveal–peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling‑in. A reinforcement‑learning policy selects saccade locations to gather multiple foveal‑peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image fed to an unchanged downstream classifier. This preprocessing aims to filter adversarial perturbations while preserving semantics; no retraining/fine‑tuning of classifiers is needed.

Result: On ImageNet, the approach increases robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types while significantly lowering training overhead relative to both biologically inspired and conventional (non‑biological) defenses.

Conclusion: Attention‑guided sparse sampling with predictive coding–like reconstruction is an effective, retraining‑free defense that mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic content, and can be seamlessly added to existing systems to improve robustness with reduced cost.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

### [16] [Detecting spills using thermal imaging, pretrained deep learning models, and a robotic platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08770)
*Gregory Yeghiyan,Jurius Azar,Devson Butani,Chan-Jin Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time spill detection using pretrained CNNs on RGB and thermal images; thermal models are faster, smaller, and more accurate, achieving up to 100% accuracy. Best performer: VGG19 on thermal; 44 ms inference on RTX 4080 with <350 MB models, validated on a real robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable robust, real-time detection of floor spills to improve safety across diverse lighting and environmental conditions, and to assess whether thermal imaging offers practical advantages over RGB for deployable systems on consumer-grade hardware.

Method: Construct a balanced 4,000-image binary dataset (spill vs. no-spill) across varied environments; finetune/evaluate multiple pretrained lightweight CNNs (e.g., VGG19, NasNetMobile) separately on RGB and thermal inputs; benchmark accuracy, inference latency, and model size; validate on a real robot.

Result: Thermal-based models outperform RGB in speed, accuracy, and robustness under differing lighting. Achieve up to 100% accuracy with lightweight architectures; best model is VGG19 on thermal. Inference as low as 44 ms on RTX 4080 with model sizes under 350 MB; real-robot tests corroborate findings.

Conclusion: Thermal imaging significantly enhances spill detection reliability and efficiency for real-time deployment. Pretrained lightweight CNNs—especially VGG19 on thermal—deliver state-of-the-art performance suitable for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time spill detection system that utilizes
pretrained deep learning models with RGB and thermal imaging to classify spill
vs. no-spill scenarios across varied environments. Using a balanced binary
dataset (4,000 images), our experiments demonstrate the advantages of thermal
imaging in inference speed, accuracy, and model size. We achieve up to 100%
accuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal
models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves
inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

### [17] [LinearSR: Unlocking Linear Attention for Stable and Efficient Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08771)
*Xiaohui Li,Shaobin Zhuang,Shuo Cao,Yang Yang,Yuandong Pu,Qi Qin,Siqi Luo,Bin Fu,Yihao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR makes Linear Attention viable for photorealistic image super‑resolution by solving training instability, the perception–distortion trade‑off, and guidance inefficiency, achieving state‑of‑the‑art perceptual quality with near 1‑NFE speed and competitive inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self‑attention’s quadratic complexity is a bottleneck for SR. Linear Attention offers O(N) scaling but has failed to deliver photorealistic SR due to unstable training, trade‑offs between fidelity and perceptual quality, and ineffective guidance schemes.

Method: A holistic framework: (1) ESGF — a knee‑point Early‑Stopping Guided Fine‑tuning procedure to prevent catastrophic divergence; (2) an SNR‑based Mixture‑of‑Experts to navigate the perception–distortion trade‑off; (3) TAG, a lightweight guidance paradigm derived from a “precision‑over‑volume” principle; all within a Linear Attention diffusion SR model.

Result: Stable training without divergence, state‑of‑the‑art perceptual quality, a 1‑NFE core diffusion forward pass with SOTA‑level speed, and overall multi‑step inference that remains highly competitive.

Conclusion: LinearSR provides the first robust recipe for applying Linear Attention to photorealistic SR, showing that efficiency and perceptual quality can co‑exist and establishing a foundation for future efficient generative SR research.

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

### [18] [Re-Identifying Kākā with AI-Automated Video Key Frame Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08775)
*Paula Maddigan,Andrew Lensen,Rachael C. Shaw*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised key‑frame extraction from feeder videos of kākā parrots using modern detectors and self‑supervised embeddings enables high‑accuracy individual re‑identification, offering a non‑invasive alternative to physical tagging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife monitoring needs accurate, scalable, and non‑invasive individual identification; traditional tagging (e.g., leg bands) is invasive and labor‑intensive. Although key‑frame selection aids human re‑ID, it is underexplored for wildlife contexts.

Method: A video-to-image pipeline: detect birds with YOLO and Grounding DINO; discard blurry frames via optical‑flow–based blur detection; encode remaining images using DINOv2; cluster embeddings to select representative key frames per individual/track for re‑identification. Evaluated on videos from a custom-built feeder.

Result: Selected key frames form image sets that achieve high re‑identification accuracy for kākā in the feeder setting, outperforming naive frame selection (implicit) and establishing a strong basis for downstream re‑ID tasks.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a non‑invasive, efficient alternative to physical tagging for recognizing individual kākā and supports broader applications in ecological monitoring; it is promising but needs validation in more diverse, challenging environments.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

### [19] [Q-Router: Agentic Video Quality Assessment with Expert Model Routing and Artifact Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08789)
*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router is an agentic, multi-tier routing framework for universal video quality assessment that uses VLMs to dynamically select and ensemble expert models, yielding stronger generalization, interpretability, and extensibility than direct score-supervised VQA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct score-supervised VQA systems generalize poorly across heterogeneous content (UGC, short-form, AIGC), provide limited interpretability, and are hard to extend to new use cases or content types. A flexible, explainable, and robust approach is needed.

Method: Use vision–language models as real-time routers that reason over input video semantics to select and ensemble specialized expert VQA models. The system is organized into compute-aware tiers; the highest tier adds spatiotemporal artifact localization for interpretability. This agentic design leverages complementary expert strengths and adapts per input and budget.

Result: Across multiple VQA benchmarks, Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving cross-domain generalization and interpretability. It achieves strong results on Q-Bench-Video and accurately localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing suitability as a reward signal for post-training video generators.

Conclusion: An extensible, robust, and interpretable VQA foundation that unifies expert models via VLM-based reasoning and routing. It consistently performs across diverse video sources and tasks and can support downstream applications such as quality-aware QA and training signals for video generation.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

### [20] [Alignment, Mining and Fusion: Representation Alignment with Hard Negative Mining and Selective Knowledge Fusion for Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08791)
*Yuanhao Zou,Zhaozheng Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified Med-VQA framework combining multi-level modality alignment, hard-negative mining with soft labels, and a gated cross-attention that leverages answer vocabulary, achieving SOTA on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VQA needs joint understanding of images and questions, but existing Med-VLP methods lack a unified alignment strategy across heterogeneous modalities, under-handle hard negatives, and risk adding irrelevant knowledge during fusion.

Method: (1) Unified heterogeneous modality alignment across levels/modalities/views/stages using contrastive learning and optimal transport. (2) Hard-negative mining with soft labels to better discriminate difficult cross-modal pairs. (3) Gated Cross-Attention Module that incorporates answer vocabulary as prior knowledge to selectively fuse only relevant information.

Result: Outperforms prior SOTA on RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-2019 benchmarks.

Conclusion: A principled alignment + discrimination + gated knowledge fusion pipeline improves Med-VQA robustness and accuracy, offering a general solution for cross-modal alignment while mitigating noise from irrelevant knowledge.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

### [21] [SkipSR: Faster Super Resolution with Token Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08799)
*Rohan Choudhury,Shanchuan Lin,Jianyi Wang,Hao Chen,Qi Zhao,Feng Cheng,Lu Jiang,Kris Kitani,Laszlo A. Jeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR speeds up diffusion-based video super-resolution by predicting low-detail regions from the low-resolution input and skipping refinement there, preserving perceptual quality while cutting end-to-end latency by up to 60% on 720p videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion SR is computationally heavy and scales poorly to higher resolutions/longer videos, yet many video regions are inherently low-detail and gain little from uniform per-pixel refinement. Exploiting this redundancy can save compute without hurting perceived quality.

Method: From the low-resolution input, predict a mask of low-detail regions and bypass SR computation on those pixels, applying diffusion-based refinement only to high-detail areas. The framework plugs into both standard multi-step and one-step diffusion SR pipelines, aiming for selective, region-aware computation skipping.

Result: On standard SR benchmarks, the approach maintains perceptual quality while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 60% for 720p videos compared with prior models. Demonstrations indicate comparable visual fidelity despite reduced computation.

Conclusion: Selective, region-aware skipping is a simple, general mechanism to accelerate diffusion-based video SR without perceptible quality loss, improving scalability to higher resolutions and longer sequences; practical integration appears straightforward across different diffusion SR variants.

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

### [22] [D-CoDe: Scaling Image-Pretrained VLMs to Video via Dynamic Compression and Question Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08818)
*Yiyang Huang,Yizhou Wang,Yun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-CoDe is a training-free way to adapt image-pretrained VLMs to video by compressing visual tokens and decomposing user queries, yielding better performance—especially on long videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based VLMs struggle with video because videos are long, redundant, and temporally complex, causing perception bottlenecks and token overload that exceed model/context limits.

Method: Two components at inference time: (1) Dynamic compression selects representative frames and aggregates spatial tokens in a content-aware way to reduce redundancy while keeping salient information. (2) Question decomposition rewrites a user query into sub-questions so the model can focus on distinct aspects sequentially, mitigating context/token strain and improving coverage.

Result: Across multiple video-language benchmarks, the approach improves video understanding, with particularly strong gains on a challenging long-video benchmark, demonstrating robustness to long temporal contexts.

Conclusion: Addressing perception bottlenecks and token overload via dynamic compression and question decomposition enables effective, training-free adaptation of image VLMs to video; results indicate strong potential for handling complex, long-video tasks. Code available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

### [23] [FOLK: Fast Open-Vocabulary 3D Instance Segmentation via Label-guided Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08849)
*Hongrui Wu,Zhicheng Gao,Jin Cao,Kelu Yao,Wen Shen,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOLK distills CLIP-based open‑vocabulary semantics from 2D multi-view evidence into a 3D student so inference runs purely in 3D—avoiding 2D occlusion noise—and achieves SOTA AP50 35.7 on ScanNet200 while being 6–152× faster than prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open‑vocabulary 3D instance segmentation often relies on projecting 3D to 2D and querying VLMs, which introduces occlusion-induced noise, large compute/memory costs, and slow inference. A method that keeps open‑vocabulary capacity but performs fast, direct 3D inference is needed.

Method: Teacher–student knowledge distillation: a teacher aggregates visibility- and viewpoint-diverse 2D CLIP embeddings per 3D instance; a 3D student network learns to produce per‑instance 3D embeddings. A label‑guided distillation scheme filters for label‑consistent 2D embeddings to transfer open‑vocabulary knowledge into the student, enabling direct 3D classification at test time.

Result: On ScanNet200 and Replica, FOLK achieves state‑of‑the‑art performance, with AP50 35.7 on ScanNet200, and accelerates inference by ~6.0× to 152.2× versus previous methods.

Conclusion: Embedding open‑vocabulary knowledge into a 3D model yields fast, occlusion‑robust 3D instance segmentation without 2D VLM calls at inference; code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

### [24] [Modeling Time-Lapse Trajectories to Characterize Cranberry Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08901)
*Ronan John,Anis Chihoub,Ryan Meegan,Gina Sidelli,Jeffery Neyhart,Peter Oudemans,Kristin Dana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They introduce a self-supervised, ViT-based method that learns 2D latent temporal tracks from time-lapse cranberry images via time regression and class prediction, enabling interpretable growth modeling without manual annotations; they also release a multi-variety, season-long cranberry dataset with management and outcome labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual crop change monitoring is labor-intensive, and deep learning methods often require costly annotations and yield opaque features. There is a need for an interpretable, annotation-light approach to model crop growth dynamics over time.

Method: Fine-tune vision transformers using a self-supervised two-pretext task: (1) time regression to map images to their position in the growing season, and (2) class prediction to retain discriminative power. The learned latent space yields 2D temporal tracks representing plant/fruit appearance evolution, trained on a new time-lapse cranberry dataset (eight varieties, 52 observations across ~4 months) with auxiliary labels (fungicide, yield, rot).

Result: The approach produces interpretable 2D trajectories capturing growth dynamics, supports forecasting of future states, and differentiates temporal patterns across cranberry varieties. The authors release the dataset and code. Quantitative performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViT-based temporal modeling can monitor crop growth without tedious annotations, offering interpretable trajectories useful for prediction and variety comparison. The method is generalizable to other crops, and accompanying data/code facilitate adoption.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.
com/ronan-39/tlt/).

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP builds a vision–language embedding space as an L1-product of multiple hyperbolic factors to jointly model hierarchical and compositional semantics, yielding better zero-shot, retrieval, hierarchical, and compositional performance with more interpretable structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision–language models struggle to represent both (a) hierarchical relations within concept families (dog ⪯ mammal ⪯ animal) and (b) compositional relations across families (e.g., dog in a car). Hyperbolic spaces capture tree-like hierarchies well but are not clearly suited to composition. The work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Construct an embedding space that is a Cartesian product of hyperbolic manifolds equipped with an L1-product metric. Each hyperbolic factor encodes intra-family hierarchy; the L1 aggregation across factors supports cross-family compositionality, akin to Boolean algebra. The approach is instantiated within a vision–language framework and trained on paired image–text data.

Result: Across zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding benchmarks, PHyCLIP outperforms single-space baselines and yields more interpretable embeddings that reflect both hierarchy and composition.

Conclusion: Choosing an L1-product of hyperbolic spaces resolves the hierarchy–composition trade-off: it maintains hyperbolic advantages for hierarchy while enabling compositional semantics. This geometry produces stronger and more interpretable multimodal representations.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

### [26] [SegTrans: Transferable Adversarial Examples for Segmentation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08922)
*Yufei Song,Ziqi Zhou,Qi Lu,Hangtao Zhang,Yifan Hu,Lulu Xue,Shengshan Hu,Minghui Li,Leo Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegTrans is a transfer-based adversarial attack for semantic segmentation that improves cross-model transfer by optimizing perturbations on locally remapped, diversity-augmented samples, focusing on local rather than global semantics. It yields notably higher transfer success rates and better efficiency on VOC and Cityscapes across multiple models/backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer attacks for segmentation underperform due to complex contextual dependencies and feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models. The authors aim to boost transferability without adding computational overhead.

Method: Partition the input into multiple local regions and remap their semantic information to synthesize diverse enhanced samples. Use these enhanced samples—retaining only local semantics—to replace the original during perturbation optimization, thereby steering gradients toward model-agnostic, locally focused perturbations instead of global context features.

Result: On PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, across four segmentation models and three backbones, SegTrans achieves a mean +8.55% improvement in transfer attack success rate over prior SOTA and improves computational efficiency by >100%, with no added overhead claimed.

Conclusion: Emphasizing local semantics via region-wise semantic remapping during optimization substantially improves transferability of adversarial examples for segmentation, offering a simple, efficient, and broadly applicable framework.

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [27] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASVP is a runtime defense for image restoration models that thwarts knowledge distillation by amplifying top‑k singular values of internal feature maps (via SVD), injecting structured high‑frequency perturbations that disrupt student learning while preserving teacher output quality; across five restoration tasks it cuts student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60–75% with negligible teacher impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge distillation enables adversaries to replicate proprietary models. Existing defenses tailored to classification (logit perturbations) do not transfer to restoration, where outputs are continuous, high‑dimensional, and require spatial coherence, making small output perturbations ineffective.

Method: Apply singular value decomposition to selected internal feature maps of the teacher at runtime and adaptively amplify the top‑k singular values to introduce structured, high‑frequency perturbations. This breaks the feature/output alignment students rely on during distillation while keeping the teacher’s perceptual quality intact; no retraining required.

Result: Across super‑resolution, low‑light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining, ASVP reduces student performance by up to 4 dB PSNR and 60–75% SSIM, with minimal degradation to the teacher, outperforming prior defenses in strength and consistency.

Conclusion: ASVP offers a practical, broadly applicable defense to protect open‑source image restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation, maintaining utility for legitimate inference while degrading illicit student training.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

### [28] [RO-Bench: Large-scale robustness evaluation of MLLMs with text-driven counterfactual videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08936)
*Zixi Yang,Jiapeng Li,Muxi Diao,Yinuo Jing,Kongming Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ro-Bench introduces a counterfactual, out-of-distribution video benchmark to stress-test MLLMs; existing models degrade markedly, while counterfactual fine-tuning boosts robustness (≈+21.7% on Ro-Bench; ≈+12.8% on MVBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video MLLMs perform well in-distribution, but their robustness to manipulated or counterfactual video content is unclear—an important gap for trustworthy video understanding and deployment.

Method: Build Ro-Bench: dynamic OOD counterfactual test sets via temporally aware edits to Style, Object, Background, and their compositions; evaluate eight recent video MLLMs; fine-tune models with counterfactual data; assess on Ro-Bench and transfer to MVBench.

Result: All tested MLLMs show substantial drops on counterfactual videos. Counterfactual fine-tuning improves performance by 21.73% on Ro-Bench and by 12.78% averaged across 20 MVBench tasks.

Conclusion: Current video MLLMs lack robustness to counterfactual shifts; targeted counterfactual data is an effective lever to improve robustness. Ro-Bench offers a standardized evaluation resource; code/data forthcoming.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

### [29] [Denoised Diffusion for Object-Focused Image Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08955)
*Nisha Pillai,Aditi Virupakshaiah,Harrison W. Smith,Amanda J. Ashworth,Prasanna Gowda,Phillip R. Owens,Adam R. Rivers,Bindu Nanduri,Mahalingam Ramkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They introduce an object-focused data augmentation pipeline—segmenting animals and using transformations plus diffusion-based synthesis—to generate realistic, diverse scenes that improve drone-based animal detection under scarce, domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drone-based animal health monitoring suffers from scarce, domain-specific data and challenging visuals (small, occluded, partially visible animals; varied breeds/environments/behaviors). Generic transfer learning underperforms without data reflecting specific farm conditions, motivating tailored augmentation.

Method: Segment animals from backgrounds; apply object-centric transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create new, realistic composites; assemble augmented scenes; train detection models on the combined real + synthetic data; evaluate on animal detection for monitoring.

Result: Initial experiments indicate the augmented dataset outperforms baseline models on animal detection, improving monitoring performance in data-limited settings (no exact metrics reported).

Conclusion: Domain-specific, object-focused augmentation can bridge data scarcity and enhance practical, real-time animal health monitoring from drones. The approach shows promise but would benefit from broader validation and quantitative reporting.

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

### [30] [Unleashing Perception-Time Scaling to Multimodal Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08964)
*Yifan Li,Zhenghao Chen,Ziheng Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruipu Luo,Can Zhang,Zhentao He,Yufei Zhan,Wayne Xin Zhao,Minghui Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They introduce a perception-centric benchmark (DisTANCE) and a new paradigm, Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), which decomposes visual perception into token-rich, verifiable sub-steps. Unlike standard inference-time scaling that helps reasoning but not perception, PTS plus RL dramatically boosts LVLM estimation accuracy (high-precision from 8.0% to 64.7%) and generalizes beyond the training domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time scaling with verifiable rewards has advanced LVLM reasoning, but its benefits for visual perception remain unclear. Current LVLMs treat perception as a one-shot output, lacking an explicit perceptual process. The authors seek to diagnose this gap and create a benchmark to measure precision in visual estimation, then design an approach that lets perception benefit from inference-time scaling.

Method: 1) Build DisTANCE, a benchmark for perception-focused visual estimation. 2) Propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), which encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception tasks into intermediate, tractable, verifiable sub-problems. 3) Combine PTS with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards. 4) Use synthetic PTS data and analyze token usage and attention to image tokens.

Result: - Baseline LVLMs show limited estimation precision; standard inference-time scaling offers marginal gains for perception. - PTS+RL substantially improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%. - The gains generalize to out-of-domain tasks. - Mixing synthetic PTS data with math reasoning data yields consistent improvements in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. - Analyses show increased perception-related tokens and greater attention to image tokens.

Conclusion: Perception should be modeled as a multi-step, token-rich process aligned with inference-time scaling. PTS operationalizes this and, when paired with RL and verifiable rewards, markedly enhances LVLM perception and transfers to broader reasoning tasks. This suggests a unified scaling strategy for both perception and reasoning; code and data will be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

### [31] [mmJoints: Expanding Joint Representations Beyond (x,y,z) in mmWave-Based 3D Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08970)
*Zhenyu Wang,Mahathir Monjur,Shahriar Nirjon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: mmJoints wraps a black‑box mmWave 3D pose estimator with per‑joint “sensed likelihood” and “location reliability” descriptors, making prior-vs-sensor contributions explicit. This improves interpretability and boosts pose and activity recognition accuracy (≤4.2% descriptor error; up to 12.5% pose and 16% activity gains).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mmWave pose estimation suffers from sparse returns and weak reflections, pushing models to over-rely on statistical priors. This hidden bias hurts downstream tasks (gesture/activity recognition). The authors aim to expose—rather than suppress—the bias by quantifying how much each joint is actually supported by sensor evidence and how trustworthy its predicted location is.

Method: Introduce mmJoints, a plug-in framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave 3D pose estimator with two per-joint descriptors: (1) likelihood that a joint was sensed by mmWave, and (2) reliability of its predicted position. The framework learns to estimate these descriptors from estimator outputs/signals, without altering the underlying pose estimator, thereby surfacing confidence tied to sensor evidence.

Result: Across 115k frames and 13 settings, mmJoints estimates descriptor values with <4.2% error, increases joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%, and improves activity recognition accuracy by up to 16% compared to SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling sensing likelihood and positional reliability per joint makes mmWave pose estimators more interpretable and more effective for downstream tasks, offering a practical, black-box-compatible enhancement rather than attempting to remove prior bias outright.

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

### [32] [Hierarchical Scheduling for Multi-Vector Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976)
*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMIR is a hierarchical, efficiency-aware image retrieval framework for RAG in multimodal LLMs that improves alignment between queries and image content across multiple granularities and prunes redundant computations, yielding higher accuracy with up to 3.5× less compute than prior multi‑vector retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional and recent multi-vector retrieval methods for MLLM RAG still suffer from limited accuracy and inefficiency because they inadequately align queries with heterogeneous image objects and over-match on fine-grained segments, causing redundancy.

Method: Introduce HiMIR, a hierarchical retrieval scheduling paradigm: (1) represent images at multiple intermediate granularities tailored to varying objects; (2) exploit cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and sparsity to prune unnecessary matching; (3) automatically configure retrieval parameters per dataset for practical deployment.

Result: Empirical studies show substantial accuracy gains over existing MVR systems while cutting computation by up to 3.5×.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, consistency- and sparsity-guided scheduling can better align queries with image content and eliminate redundant matching, delivering both accuracy and efficiency improvements for RAG in MLLMs, with automated parameter tuning supporting diverse scenarios.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

### [33] [HandEval: Taking the First Step Towards Hand Quality Evaluation in Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08978)
*Zichuan Wang,Bo Peng,Songlin Yang,Zhenchen Tang,Jing Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They introduce HandPair (48k high/low-quality hand image pairs) and HandEval, a hand-specific quality assessor built on an MLLM with hand-keypoint priors, which better matches human judgments and boosts both T2I hand realism and AIGC detection when used in pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models still fail on complex local details—especially hands—causing noticeable artifacts. There is no dedicated, reliable way to assess the quality of generated hands, which hampers optimization and detection workflows.

Method: 1) Build HandPair: a 48k dataset of paired high/low-quality hand images to enable supervised training without manual labeling; 2) Propose HandEval: an MLLM-based hand-quality assessor augmented with hand keypoint priors; 3) Create a human-annotated, multi-model test set of hand crops; 4) Evaluate HandEval against SOTA assessors and integrate it into generation and AIGC-detection pipelines.

Result: HandEval correlates with human judgments better than existing SOTA methods. When used in T2I generation loops, it improves the realism of generated hands; when used for AIGC detection, it raises detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Hand-centric quality assessment is both feasible and broadly useful. HandEval and HandPair provide a strong foundation for assessing and improving hand realism in generative images, with demonstrable gains in downstream tasks. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

### [34] [Uncolorable Examples: Preventing Unauthorized AI Colorization via Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08979)
*Yuki Nii,Futa Waseda,Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a practical defense—PAChroma—that embeds imperceptible, perception-aware perturbations into grayscale images to make AI colorization fail across models and post-processing, while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI colorization can be exploited to illegally colorize and resell grayscale media (e.g., manga, films). There is no established method to prevent such misuse, motivating a proactive, creator-controlled defense.

Method: Define a defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which adds tiny perturbations to grayscale inputs. PAChroma optimizes these perturbations using a perception-aware objective with a Laplacian filter to maintain perceptual fidelity and employs diverse input transformations during optimization to improve transferability to unseen colorizers and robustness to common post-processing (e.g., compression).

Result: On ImageNet and Danbooru, PAChroma substantially degrades the quality of colorization produced by AI models while keeping the grayscale appearance visually unchanged. It remains effective across different colorization models and after typical processing steps.

Conclusion: PAChroma is a first, practical step toward copyright-aware defenses in generative media, offering effective, imperceptible, transferable, and robust protection against unauthorized AI colorization.

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

*Yao Teng,Fuyun Wang,Xian Liu,Zhekai Chen,Han Shi,Yu Wang,Zhenguo Li,Weiyang Liu,Difan Zou,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SJD2 parallelizes autoregressive text-to-image decoding by integrating a denoising-aware Jacobi iteration that predicts “next clean tokens” from noisy embeddings, enabling multi-token acceptance per step and reducing forward passes without hurting image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive T2I models decode one token at a time, leading to very slow inference (thousands of passes). A method is needed to break the sequential bottleneck while preserving sample quality.

Method: Introduce a next-clean-token prediction task via light fine-tuning so the pretrained AR model can accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and output clean next tokens. At inference, initialize the token sequence with Gaussian noise and iteratively update all positions in parallel (Jacobi-style) in embedding space. Use a probabilistic acceptance test to verify and commit multiple tokens per iteration; unaccepted tokens are denoised/refined in subsequent iterations along the denoising trajectory.

Result: Empirically reduces the number of model forward passes needed to generate images while maintaining visual quality (no specific metrics reported in the abstract).

Conclusion: Coupling denoising with Jacobi iterations provides an effective speculative-parallel decoding framework for AR T2I models, accelerating generation without degrading image fidelity.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

### [36] [Improving the Performance of Unimodal Dynamic Hand-Gesture Recognition with Multimodal Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06145)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Train separate 3D-CNNs per modality and align their spatiotemporal features so each unimodal model learns multimodal semantics; add a focal regularizer to avoid harmful transfer; yields SOTA unimodal gesture recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment often requires fast, single-modality inference, yet multimodal training can provide complementary cues. Existing methods fuse modalities explicitly, complicating inference and dependence on multiple sensors. The goal is to distill multimodal knowledge into unimodal 3D-CNNs without requiring multimodal input at test time and to avoid negative knowledge transfer.

Method: Create one network per available modality and train them jointly with a spatiotemporal semantic alignment (SSA) loss that encourages their intermediate feature maps to share common semantics across space and time. Introduce a focal regularization parameter that adaptively down-weights alignment when modalities disagree, mitigating negative transfer. After training, any single unimodal network can be used alone at test time.

Result: Unimodal models trained with SSA + focal regularization achieve higher test accuracy than their unimodal baselines and reach state-of-the-art results on multiple dynamic hand gesture datasets (specific datasets not listed in the abstract).

Conclusion: Embedding multimodal knowledge via SSA into unimodal 3D-CNNs, with focal regularization to control transfer, improves representations and recognition accuracy while preserving unimodal test-time efficiency, offering a practical alternative to explicit multimodal fusion.

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

TL;DR: They reduce object hallucination in LVLMs by detecting high-uncertainty visual tokens (via adversarial-sensitivity as a proxy) inside the vision encoder and masking those tokens during mid-layer self-attention, yielding significantly fewer hallucinations and working well with other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often describe objects not present in the image. The authors hypothesize that unstable/uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder contribute to these hallucinations and seek a simple, encoder-side fix that does not modify the language model or require heavy retraining.

Method: 1) Empirically and theoretically link epistemic uncertainty to token sensitivity: early-layer tokens that change a lot under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. 2) Use small adversarial perturbations as a proxy to efficiently identify such uncertain tokens. 3) Mask the identified tokens during self-attention in the middle layers of the vision encoder to suppress their influence on the final encoding. The approach only modifies the VE and is plug-and-play with LVLMs.

Result: Statistical analysis shows positive correlation between high-uncertainty tokens and hallucinations. Experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in object hallucinations, and the method composes synergistically with existing techniques. (No specific metrics reported in the abstract.)

Conclusion: Uncertain visual tokens inside the vision encoder are a key driver of object hallucination. Detecting them via adversarial sensitivity and masking them within the encoder effectively mitigates hallucinations and complements prior art, offering a simple, general, VE-only mitigation strategy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

### [38] [Deep Sparse Representation-based Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11093)
*Mahdi Abavisani,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose a transductive deep SRC model that embeds sparse coding inside a convolutional autoencoder via a fully connected layer, producing sparse codes used for classification and outperforming prior SRC methods on three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical SRC relies on hand-crafted features and separate sparse coding, which may be suboptimal and less robust. The authors aim to jointly learn robust deep features and sparse representations—potentially leveraging transductive information—to improve classification accuracy.

Method: Build a convolutional autoencoder; insert a fully connected layer between encoder and decoder to act as the sparse coding module. Train the network so the autoencoder learns robust features and the FC layer yields sparse codes, which are then used as inputs for a classifier. The approach is transductive, suggesting it can utilize test data distribution during training.

Result: Across three datasets, the learned sparse codes lead to better classification performance than state-of-the-art SRC baselines. Public code is provided (github.com/mahdiabavisani/DSRC).

Conclusion: Embedding sparse coding within a deep autoencoder yields robust, discriminative sparse representations that improve SRC classification performance; the method is effective across multiple datasets and is reproducible via released code.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

### [39] [Towards Better & Faster Autoregressive Image Generation: From the Perspective of Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09012)
*Xiaoxiao Ma,Feng Zhao,Pengyang Ling,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiang Wei,Hu Yu,Jie Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose an entropy-informed decoding scheme for autoregressive (AR) image generators that adapts temperature spatially and adjusts speculative decoding acceptance using token entropy, yielding better quality and faster sampling across models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR image generation lags because image tokens have lower information density and uneven spatial distribution compared to text tokens. Standard, text-inspired sampling (fixed temperature, naive speculative acceptance) mishandles uncertainty, harming fidelity/structure or speed.

Method: 1) Dynamic temperature control driven by spatial entropy of token distributions to balance diversity, alignment, and structural coherence in mask-based and scale-wise AR models without extra compute. 2) Entropy-aware acceptance rules for speculative decoding to accept/replace tokens based on uncertainty, targeting near-lossless quality while accelerating inference.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks and AR model families, the approach improves generation quality while reducing sampling cost; speculative decoding with entropy-aware acceptance achieves near-lossless quality at ~85% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration baselines.

Conclusion: Modeling and leveraging spatial entropy in AR image decoding fixes a modality mismatch in sampling, providing a general, compute-neutral way to improve both quality and speed. The strategy is broadly applicable to different AR architectures and decoding schemes.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

### [40] [Exploring Single Domain Generalization of LiDAR-based Semantic Segmentation under Imperfect Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09035)
*Weitong Kong,Zichao Zeng,Di Wen,Jiale Wei,Kunyu Peng,June Moh Goo,Jan Boehm,Rainer Stiefelhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They define a new setting—domain generalization for LiDAR semantic segmentation with noisy labels (DGLSS-NL)—show prior noisy-label methods adapt poorly to 3D, and propose DuNe, a dual-view consistency and confidence-filtering framework that achieves SOTA mIoU across SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles need LiDAR segmentation that generalizes across domains without costly re-labeling. Real LiDAR annotations are noisy (sensor limits, occlusion, human error) and domain shifts amplify errors. Existing noisy-label learning is 2D-focused and ill-suited for sparse, irregular point clouds, leaving a gap for 3D domain generalization under label noise.

Method: 1) Formulate the DGLSS-NL task and create a benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D LiDAR segmentation. 2) Propose DuNe: a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches; enforce feature-level consistency between views; train with cross-entropy on predictions selected via confidence-aware filtering to mitigate noisy labels.

Result: Under 10% symmetric label noise, DuNe attains SOTA domain generalization: 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS, with AM 49.57% and HM 48.50%. Existing adapted noisy-label methods underperform on LiDAR segmentation.

Conclusion: DuNe effectively handles label noise while generalizing across domains for LiDAR 3D semantic segmentation, outperforming adapted baselines and establishing a first benchmark for DGLSS-NL. The approach improves robustness without re-annotation; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

### [41] [Lesion-Aware Post-Training of Latent Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Diffusion MRI from CT Perfusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09056)
*Junhyeok Lee,Hyunwoong Kim,Hyungjin Chung,Heeseong Eom,Joon Jang,Chul-Ho Sohn,Kyu Sung Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lesion-aware post-training for latent diffusion models improves pixel-level fidelity and lesion depiction in medical image-to-image translation, outperforming baselines on CT-to-MRI synthesis for acute stroke.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LDMs learn efficiently in latent space but can miss small, clinically critical details (e.g., lesions), risking unreliable diagnostics. MRI is ideal for stroke but less accessible, motivating accurate CT-to-MRI translation that preserves lesion information.

Method: A post-training framework that augments pre-trained LDMs with lesion-aware pixel-space objectives to better reconstruct fine, clinically relevant structures. Applied to synthesize DWI and ADC from CT perfusion in acute ischemic stroke; designed to be plug-and-play with existing LDMs.

Result: On a dataset of 817 patients, the approach improves overall image quality and lesion delineation in DWI/ADC synthesis from CT perfusion, surpassing existing image-to-image translation models.

Conclusion: Lesion-aware pixel-space post-training mitigates latent-space detail loss in LDMs, yielding higher-fidelity, clinically more reliable translations. The strategy is easily adapted to pre-trained LDMs and shows promise for broader medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

*Yitong Chen,Xinyao Xu,Ping Zhu,Xinyong Han,Fangbo Qin,Shan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose a unified, image-based anomaly detection framework for robotic flexible microelectrode implantation using ROI-aligned ViT features, progressive patch sampling, and SNR-based channel selection, validated on in-house datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implanting flexible microelectrodes is difficult due to probe deformability and delicate brain tissue. Continuous, reliable visual monitoring is needed to ensure safety and success during key steps of robotic implantation.

Method: Use microscopic cameras to monitor four checkpoints (micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, implantation point). From existing object localization, extract aligned ROIs and feed them to a pretrained ViT. Introduce progressive granularity patch feature sampling to balance sensitivity vs. tolerance at different locations, and select high-SNR feature channels from ViT to create scene-specific descriptors for anomaly detection.

Result: On datasets collected from their implantation system, the proposed sampling and channel-selection strategies are reported as effective; the abstract claims validation but provides no quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical, unified anomaly detection pipeline that adapts to different surgical checkpoints, potentially improving reliability and safety of robotic FME implantation. Further quantitative evaluation and benchmarking would strengthen the claim.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

*Weijia Wang,Yuanzhi Su,Pei-Gen Ye,Yuan-Gen Wang,Xuequan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit introduces a state-space–driven, hyper-surface fitting framework that fuses multi-scale local features and models patches as implicit surfaces to significantly improve point cloud normal estimation in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing normal estimation methods under-capture fine-grained geometric structures, and current Mamba-based point cloud approaches prioritize global shape understanding over local detail, limiting normal prediction accuracy.

Method: 1) Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) adaptively fuses multi-scale patch features to enrich local geometric context. 2) Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) treats each patch as an implicit hyper-surface and leverages state dynamics to capture fine-grained geometry for normal prediction. Built on SSMs (Mamba) to exploit long-range dependencies with linear complexity while focusing on local details.

Result: On benchmark datasets, MambaH-Fit outperforms prior methods in accuracy, robustness, and flexibility; ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of AHFF and PSSM.

Conclusion: Combining AHFF with a patch-wise SSM for implicit hyper-surface modeling effectively captures fine-grained local geometry, advancing state of the art in point cloud normal estimation and demonstrating robust, flexible performance.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

*Juanqin Liu,Leonardo Plotegher,Eloy Roura,Shaoming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GL-DT is a UAV-focused MOT framework that fuses spatio-temporal features and combines global-local detection with a new JPTrack tracker, reducing ID switches and fragmentation while keeping real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV applications (military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring) require accurate, efficient MOT, but small objects, cluttered backgrounds, and frequent occlusions/interactions degrade detection and trajectory continuity.

Method: Propose Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT). Use a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance. Apply a global-local collaborative detection strategy to boost small-target detection. Introduce JPTrack to alleviate ID switches and trajectory breaks.

Result: Experiments show significantly improved tracking continuity and stability under UAV scenarios while maintaining real-time performance; better small-target detection and fewer ID switches/fragmentations.

Conclusion: Joint global-local detection with STFF plus JPTrack provides robust, real-time UAV MOT, addressing small-scale targets and occlusions and improving trajectory integrity for practical UAV situational awareness.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Youwei Zheng,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense2MoE converts dense Diffusion Transformers into MoE-style models and selectively activates experts and blocks, cutting active parameters by ~60% while maintaining text-to-image quality, outperforming pruning-based compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT models achieve strong T2I results but are heavy at inference. Traditional pruning reduces parameter count but also model capacity, often harming generation quality. The goal is to lower inference cost without sacrificing capacity or performance.

Method: 1) Replace each DiT block’s FFN with a Mixture-of-Experts layer, reducing activated FFN parameters by 62.5%. 2) Introduce Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to gate/select which DiT blocks run per input. 3) Multi-step dense-to-MoE distillation: Taylor-metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing to prevent expert collapse, and a group feature loss to train MoB routing. Applied to large DiTs (e.g., FLUX.1 [dev]).

Result: On large diffusion transformers, the approach reduces activated parameters by ~60% while preserving original performance and surpassing pruning baselines across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Structured sparsification via MoE experts and block gating offers an effective path to efficient text-to-image generation, retaining capacity and quality while reducing active compute; Dense2MoE sets a strong baseline for MoE-ified diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-branch ConvNeXt model (GAP, GMP, and attention-weighted pooling) with a careful two-phase, transfer-learning pipeline delivers near–state-of-the-art COVID-19 CT classification performance (AUC 0.9937; Acc 0.9757; F1 0.9825) on 2,609 slices, and is proposed as a general framework for medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance detection of subtle pathological features in CT images and provide a robust, generalizable architecture and training pipeline for medical imaging tasks where prior models may underperform or lack rigorous end-to-end handling.

Method: An end-to-end approach combining meticulous preprocessing/augmentation and a two-phase training regime leveraging transfer learning. The architecture uses a ConvNeXt backbone with three parallel feature-pooling branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a novel Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism, whose features are integrated for classification. Training/validation used 2,609 CT slices combined from two datasets.

Result: On the validation set, the model achieved ROC-AUC 0.9937, accuracy 0.9757, and F1-score 0.9825 for COVID-19 classification, outperforming previously reported models on the same dataset.

Conclusion: A modern multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture, paired with disciplined data handling and transfer learning, can match or exceed contemporary state-of-the-art performance for medical CT diagnostics and may generalize to other pathologies.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

### [47] [SOS: Synthetic Object Segments Improve Detection, Segmentation, and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09110)
*Weikai Huang,Jieyu Zhang,Taoyang Jia,Chenhao Zheng,Ziqi Gao,Jae Sung Park,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS is a simple, controllable synthetic data pipeline that pastes high-quality object segments into images using layout priors and generative relighting, producing masks/boxes/referring expressions that train models to outperform much larger real-image datasets on detection and grounding, with especially strong gains in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual grouping tasks (instance segmentation, visual grounding, detection) need large, diverse, well-annotated data. Real datasets are expensive, biased, and hard to scale; existing synthetic data lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity. A scalable, controllable way to generate accurate, diverse annotations is needed.

Method: Object-centric composition pipeline (SOS): paste high-quality synthetic object segments into new backgrounds guided by structured layout priors and enhanced by generative relighting. This yields accurate masks, bounding boxes, and referring expressions. The pipeline supports controllable dataset construction and targeted synthesis (e.g., intra-class referring).

Result: Training on 100k SOS images beats models trained on much larger real datasets (e.g., GRIT 20M, V3Det 200k). Reported gains: +10.9 AP on LVIS detection; +8.4 N_Acc on gRefCOCO grounding. Augmenting LVIS/COCO with SOS segments improves performance across data scales, with large boosts in scarce-data regimes (e.g., +3.83 AP_rare on LVIS instance segmentation; +6.59 AP with 1% COCO). Improves generalization in low-data and closed-vocabulary settings.

Conclusion: Synthetic object-centric composition with layout priors and relighting can produce training data that not only match but surpass large real datasets for visual grouping. SOS offers controllability for focused data generation and yields robust gains, particularly in low-data and closed-vocabulary scenarios.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

### [48] [MSDM: Generating Task-Specific Pathology Images with a Multimodal Conditioned Diffusion Model for Cell and Nuclei Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09121)
*Dominik Winter,Mai Bui,Monica Azqueta Gavaldon,Nicolas Triltsch,Marco Rosati,Nicolas Brieu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose a multimodal, conditional diffusion model that generates realistic, pixel-aligned image–mask pairs for cell/nuclei segmentation by conditioning on morphology maps, color cues, and BERT-encoded metadata, and show that such synthetic data narrows the real–synthetic gap and boosts segmentation accuracy for rare morphologies (e.g., columnar cells).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated data for rare or atypical cellular morphologies is scarce and costly to obtain, limiting segmentation performance and generalizability in computational pathology. Synthetic data could fill gaps and target model weaknesses but must be realistic, controllable, and paired with masks.

Method: Introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) that conditions the generative process on: (1) morphology via horizontal/vertical (HV) maps, (2) RGB color characteristics, and (3) BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata. These inputs are fused through multi-head cross-attention to enable fine-grained control. The model generates pixel-precise image–mask pairs. Evaluation uses embedding-space Wasserstein distances between generated and real images under matched biological conditions, and downstream tests augment segmentation training sets (e.g., with columnar cells).

Result: Generated images closely match real data distributions (low Wasserstein distances). Incorporating targeted synthetic samples substantially improves segmentation accuracy for underrepresented morphologies, demonstrated on columnar cells, effectively addressing model deficiencies.

Conclusion: Multimodal diffusion-based augmentation can systematically enrich datasets and improve robustness/generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models, suggesting broader utility of generative models in computational pathology.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

### [49] [Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)
*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT is a separable, orthogonal polar transform that factorizes radial and angular processing (DCT × Fourier), slashing complexity and improving numerical stability versus classical Zernike-type moments while retaining exact reconstruction and strong practical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment descriptors (e.g., Zernike/pseudo‑Zernike) are powerful but become computationally prohibitive and numerically unstable at high orders due to non‑separable radial–angular processing in polar coordinates, leading to O(n^3–n^6 N^2) cost and O(N^4) condition number scaling.

Method: Introduce PSepT (Polar Separable Transform), which achieves full kernel factorization by constructing radial bases with Discrete Cosine Transforms and angular bases with Fourier harmonics, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This tensor‑product design yields an orthogonal, complete, energy‑preserving, rotation‑covariant transform with O(N^2 log N) time and O(N^2) memory.

Result: Compared to Zernike-type methods, PSepT reduces complexity to O(N^2 log N), memory to O(N^2), and condition number scaling to O(√N). Experiments show improved numerical stability and speed, competitive classification on structured datasets, and exact reconstruction capability.

Conclusion: A separable polar framework makes high‑order moment analysis practical, overcoming instability and cost barriers of classical methods and enabling robust, scalable image analysis applications.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

### [50] [Training Feature Attribution for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09135)
*Aziz Bacha,Thomas George*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes training feature attribution: a method that links a test prediction to specific regions within specific training images, exposing harmful training examples and spurious, patch-level shortcuts that standard attribution misses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks are opaque; current explainability methods either attribute to input features (saliency) or to training examples (influence) but not both. A joint perspective could increase trust and accountability by pinpointing which parts of which training images drive a given test prediction, helping to detect misguiding data and spurious correlations.

Method: Introduce training feature attribution that decomposes a test prediction into contributions from localized regions of individual training images. The approach assigns fine-grained influence scores to patches/regions in training data with respect to a specific test example, effectively combining feature-level attribution with example-level influence analysis.

Result: On vision datasets, the method yields test-specific, fine-grained explanations; it identifies harmful training instances that cause misclassifications and uncovers spurious correlations (e.g., patch-based shortcuts) that conventional attribution methods fail to reveal.

Conclusion: Jointly attributing predictions to features and training samples provides richer, actionable explanations for debugging models and datasets, complementing existing saliency and influence approaches and improving insight into model behavior.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

### [51] [Online Topological Localization for Navigation Assistance in Bronchoscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09144)
*Clara Tomasini,Luis Riazuelo,Ana C. Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CT-free, image-only topological localization for bronchoscopy trained on phantom data that generalizes to real procedures and outperforms prior methods on real test sequences, offering practical navigation assistance without metric tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bronchoscopy navigation is hard due to complex airway anatomy and operator variability. Existing guidance needs patient-specific CT, sensors, and registration—costly, time-consuming, and training-heavy. Since surgeons often only need where they are in the airway topology (not exact metric pose), a lighter-weight, topological solution is desirable.

Method: An image-based pipeline that localizes the bronchoscope topologically within a generic airway model, eliminating patient CT and external sensors. The system is trained solely on phantom data to avoid expensive real data labeling, aiming for strong domain generalization to real bronchoscopy videos.

Result: Demonstrates good generalization from phantom to real data and surpasses existing methods, particularly on real-world test sequences.

Conclusion: Topological, CT-free, image-based localization can feasibly assist bronchoscopy navigation with lower setup and labeling burden. When metric precision is unnecessary, this approach offers a practical alternative to CT/sensor-based systems.

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

### [52] [Instance-Level Generation for Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09171)
*Yankun Wu,Zakaria Laskar,Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos,Noa Garcia,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They replace costly ILR dataset collection with a fully synthetic, domain-name–driven data generator and fine-tune foundation vision models on it, yielding strong retrieval gains on seven ILR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instance-level recognition demands extremely fine-grained, large-scale annotations, which are expensive and limit ILR’s deployment across domains. A scalable alternative to manual data collection is needed.

Method: Automatically synthesize diverse object instances across multiple domains and scene conditions (backgrounds, viewpoints, lighting) to form a large training set tailored to ILR; use no real images; fine-tune foundation vision models on this synthetic corpus; user only supplies target domain names.

Result: Fine-tuning on the synthetic data significantly improves instance-retrieval performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains, outperforming prior automatic synthesis approaches.

Conclusion: Fully synthetic, ILR-specific data can effectively train/fine-tune foundation models, offering an efficient alternative to large-scale manual curation and enabling practical ILR applications using only domain names as input.

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

### [53] [TARO: Toward Semantically Rich Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09173)
*Yuchen Zhang,Yao Lu,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO is an open-set object detection framework that not only flags unknown objects but also assigns them to coarse parent categories using a semantic hierarchy, via a sparsemax objectness head, hierarchy-guided relabeling, and hierarchical classification, achieving competitive detection while categorizing ~30% of unknowns meaningfully.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-world detectors fail on unseen objects; existing open-set methods lump all unknowns into a single class, which is inadequate for safety-critical decisions (e.g., distinguishing unknown animals vs debris). The goal is to provide more actionable unknown categorizations and reduce confusion with known classes.

Method: Introduce TARO with (1) a sparsemax-based head to model objectness and better separate unknowns, (2) a hierarchy-guided relabeling module providing auxiliary supervision from a semantic taxonomy, and (3) a classification head trained to learn hierarchical relationships, enabling assignment of unknowns to coarse parent categories.

Result: TARO categorizes up to 29.9% of unknown instances into informative coarse classes, significantly reduces confusion between unknown and known categories, and maintains competitive performance on both unknown recall and known-class mAP. Code to be released.

Conclusion: Leveraging semantic hierarchies enables more informative handling of unknowns in open-set detection. TARO improves practical decision-making (especially in safety-critical settings) by moving beyond a single 'Unknown' label, without sacrificing standard detection performance; it provides a blueprint for hierarchical open-set detectors.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

### [54] [Online Video Depth Anything: Temporally-Consistent Depth Prediction with Low Memory Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09182)
*Johann-Friedrich Feiden,Tim Küchler,Denis Zavadski,Bogdan Savchynskyy,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: oVDA is an online, low-VRAM, real-time extension of Video Depth Anything that borrows LLM-style feature caching and frame masking to deliver state-of-the-art monocular video depth estimates at up to 42 FPS (A100) and 20 FPS (Jetson).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strong monocular video depth models like VDA work well on long sequences but require batch processing, preventing real-time/streaming use and limiting deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. A method that keeps VDA-level accuracy while supporting online inference and low VRAM is needed.

Method: Convert VDA to an online pipeline by (1) caching latent features across frames during inference (analogous to LLM KV-caching) to avoid recomputation and reduce memory, and (2) masking frames during training so the model learns to operate with partial temporal context. Implementation targets efficient VRAM usage and portability, with code and build scripts for deployment on low-power hardware.

Result: oVDA surpasses existing online video depth methods in both accuracy and VRAM usage. It achieves 42 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 and 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device, enabling real-time streaming depth estimation with low memory footprint.

Conclusion: LLM-inspired caching and frame masking enable online VDA to deliver accurate, memory-efficient, and real-time depth estimation suitable for edge deployment. Releasing code and compilation scripts should facilitate practical adoption.

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

### [55] [Modern Deep Learning Approaches for Cricket Shot Classification: A Comprehensive Baseline Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09187)
*Sungwoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive, reproducible baseline for cricket shot classification shows large gaps between prior reported accuracies and standardized re-implementations; an EfficientNet-B0 + GRU pipeline attains 92.25% on a unified benchmark, underscoring the need for consistent evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cricket shot recognition requires robust spatiotemporal modeling, but the literature lacks standardized, reproducible benchmarks and may overstate performance. The study aims to quantify true performance across paradigms and establish a reliable baseline.

Method: Implemented and evaluated seven deep learning approaches spanning CNN+LSTM, attention-based models, vision transformers, transfer learning, and EfficientNet-GRU on a single unified benchmark. Re-implemented prior state-of-the-art claims under consistent settings, using PyTorch Lightning and modern MLOps for reproducibility.

Result: Standardized re-implementations of prior works achieved 46.0%, 55.6%, and 57.7% versus claimed 96%, 99.2%, and 93%. The best modern configuration (EfficientNet-B0 for spatial features + GRU for temporal modeling) reached 92.25% accuracy.

Conclusion: Reported high accuracies in prior papers may stem from non-standard protocols or implementation issues. With consistent evaluation and modern architectures, strong performance is achievable. The released, reproducible framework highlights the critical role of standardized protocols in sports video analysis.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

### [56] [Towards Safer and Understandable Driver Intention Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09200)
*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DAAD-X, a multimodal ego-centric dataset with hierarchical causal textual explanations for driver intent prediction, and VCBM, a video concept-bottleneck model that provides intrinsic, spatio-temporally coherent explanations; finds transformer-based variants more interpretable than CNNs and presents a multilabel t-SNE to visualize disentangled causal factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based autonomous driving systems need interpretable decision-making—especially anticipating driver maneuvers—to ensure safety and effective human–machine interaction; current models are black boxes with limited insight into causal reasoning.

Method: 1) Curate DAAD-X: a multimodal, ego-centric video dataset pairing actions with hierarchical, high-level textual explanations derived from driver eye-gaze and ego-vehicle context. 2) Propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM) to predict intermediate, spatio-temporally coherent concepts that inherently explain maneuver predictions, avoiding post-hoc methods; implement with both transformer- and CNN-based backbones. 3) Introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization to depict disentanglement and causal correlations among multiple explanations.

Result: On DAAD-X, VCBM with transformer backbones yields higher interpretability than CNN-based counterparts; multilabel t-SNE visualizations illustrate clear disentanglement and causal relations among explanatory factors.

Conclusion: Concept-bottleneck modeling plus multimodal explanatory data enables interpretable driver intent prediction. DAAD-X, VCBM, and the visualization tool collectively advance interpretable AD research; resources are publicly released for reproducibility and further study.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

### [57] [Cattle-CLIP: A Multimodal Framework for Cattle Behaviour Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09203)
*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP adapts a vision–language model (CLIP) with temporal integration, tailored augmentations, and specialized prompts to recognize six indoor cattle behaviors from video, achieving 96.1% accuracy and strong few-shot generalization on a newly released dataset (CattleBehaviours6).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated, accurate monitoring of cattle behavior is vital for health, productivity, and welfare. Existing video deep learning methods face data scarcity and domain shift from web-trained models to farm surveillance, limiting robustness and deployability. The work targets data-efficient behavior recognition under realistic farm conditions.

Method: Adapt CLIP to video by adding a temporal integration module to aggregate frame-level features; incorporate semantic text prompts as guidance; bridge domain gap with tailored data augmentations and specialized prompts; evaluate in fully supervised and few-shot settings; construct and release CattleBehaviours6 with six indoor behaviors (feeding, drinking, standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming, lying-ruminating), 1905 clips from 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.

Result: In supervised experiments, the method achieves 96.1% overall accuracy, with near-100% recall for feeding, drinking, and standing-ruminating. It also generalizes well with limited labeled data in few-shot scenarios, demonstrating robustness in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: Multimodal vision–language learning with temporal integration effectively improves cattle behavior recognition, especially when labeled data are limited. The released dataset and results indicate practical potential for livestock monitoring and welfare assessment, encouraging further work on domain adaptation and low-label regimes in agricultural AI.

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

### [58] [3D Reconstruction from Transient Measurements with Time-Resolved Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09205)
*Yue Li,Shida Sun,Yu Hong,Feihu Xu,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) tailored to transient photon measurements, delivering state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction for both LOS and NLOS imaging via multi-scale spatio-temporal attention, with released code and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photon-efficient transient imaging suffers from low sensor quantum efficiency, high noise, and challenging long-range/complex scenes, making accurate 3D reconstruction difficult. Existing transformers are not tailored to the unique spatio-temporal structure of transient data, and there is a lack of large, diverse datasets to train robust models.

Method: Design a generic Time-Resolved Transformer with two key components: (1) spatio-temporal self-attention encoders that capture local and global correlations by splitting/downsampling features into multiple scales; (2) spatio-temporal cross-attention decoders that fuse local and global tokens to produce rich representations. Instantiate two variants: TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS. Additionally, provide a large, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with varying noise and collect real NLOS measurements using a custom system.

Result: Both TRT-LOS and TRT-NLOS significantly outperform prior methods on synthetic and real datasets across different imaging systems (exact metrics not specified in the abstract).

Conclusion: TRT serves as a versatile backbone for photon-efficient 3D reconstruction from transient data in both LOS and NLOS settings, improving robustness under noise and data scarcity. The released datasets and code aim to catalyze further research and adoption.

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

### [59] [Stable Video Infinity: Infinite-Length Video Generation with Error Recycling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09212)
*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI is a training-and-inference framework that recycles a model’s own errors to enable stable, controllable, infinite-length video generation with high temporal consistency and state-of-the-art performance, without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video generators drift over time. Existing fixes (e.g., altered schedulers, frame anchoring) are ad hoc, restrict content diversity, and largely support only single-prompt extrapolation. The deeper issue is a train–test mismatch: models are trained on clean data but must autoregress on their own imperfect outputs at inference, causing compounding errors.

Method: Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning for Diffusion Transformers (DiT): (i) inject historically observed, model-made errors into otherwise clean inputs to simulate error accumulation during flow-matching training; (ii) use one-step bidirectional integration to efficiently approximate predictions and compute residual-based error signals; (iii) bank these errors across discretized timesteps in a replay memory and resample them to supervise new inputs—forming a closed-loop, autoregressive error-recycling process. Compatible with multiple conditions (audio, skeleton, text).

Result: SVI generates videos that scale from seconds to effectively infinite durations with high temporal consistency, plausible scene transitions, and controllable streaming storylines, all with no additional inference-time cost. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmarks spanning consistent, creative, and conditional settings.

Conclusion: By aligning training with autoregressive test-time realities—teaching the model to detect and correct its own errors—SVI overcomes drift and repetition, enabling versatile, scalable, and controllable infinite video generation that sets a new state of the art.

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

### [60] [Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention with Large Language Models for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09224)
*Wangyu Wu,Xuhang Chen,Zhenhong Chen,Jing-En Jiang,Kim-Fung Tsang,Xiaowei Huang,Fei Ma,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM uses LLM-generated semantic tags and a tag-enriched multi-attention architecture to improve cross-domain sequential recommendation, achieving state-of-the-art results on four large e-commerce datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern platforms serve diverse domains (books, movies, retail), so recommenders must jointly capture domain-specific and cross-domain behavioral patterns—something existing CDSR models struggle to do with limited semantic understanding.

Method: Use LLMs with domain-aware prompts to generate descriptive, domain-aware tags from item titles/descriptions; embed these tags and fuse them with item IDs plus textual and visual features to build richer item representations; apply a Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention mechanism to jointly model within- and cross-domain user preferences over time.

Result: Across four large-scale e-commerce datasets, the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the benefits of LLM-based tag enrichment and the multi-attention design.

Conclusion: Integrating LLM-driven semantic tagging with multi-attention yields stronger cross-domain preference modeling and practical gains for consumer-facing recommendation systems, highlighting LLMs’ potential in intelligent, user-centric services.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

### [61] [Clear Roads, Clear Vision: Advancements in Multi-Weather Restoration for Smart Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09228)
*Vijay M. Galshetwar,Praful Hambarde,Prashant W. Patil,Akshay Dudhane,Sachin Chaudhary,Santosh Kumar Vipparathi,Subrahmanyam Murala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Survey of weather-degraded image/video restoration for intelligent transportation, offering a unified taxonomy (prior-based vs. data-driven: CNNs/Transformers/diffusion/VLMs), task scope (single, multi-weather, all-in-one), day/night considerations, benchmarks/evaluation, and a roadmap highlighting compound-degradation, real-time, and agentic-AI directions, with a living repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather (haze, rain, snow, nighttime) severely degrades visual inputs crucial for ITS (autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, surveillance), threatening safety and reliability. A consolidated review is needed to organize methods, expose gaps, and guide robust, deployable restoration.

Method: Systematic survey that: (1) categorizes methods into prior-based and data-driven families (CNNs, Transformers, diffusion, VLMs); (2) classifies by scope—single-task, multi-weather, and all-in-one restoration; (3) analyzes day vs. night challenges; (4) summarizes datasets and evaluation protocols; (5) discusses limitations and proposes future directions; (6) maintains an up-to-date repository of papers and code.

Result: Delivers a comprehensive taxonomy and comparative synthesis of weather-restoration approaches; maps challenges across lighting conditions; consolidates benchmarks and evaluation practices; identifies key gaps (compound/mixed degradations, generalization, efficiency for real-time); and spotlights promising trends (all-in-one models, diffusion/VLM integration, agentic AI). Provides a maintained GitHub resource for ongoing updates.

Conclusion: Current research is fragmented across tasks and weather types, with limited handling of compound degradations and real-time constraints. Progress likely hinges on unified, efficient, and generalizable models (including VLM- and agentic-AI-based systems), better benchmark coverage (day/night, multi-weather), and practical deployment focus. The survey and living repository aim to steer and accelerate these advances.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and
video restoration techniques developed to mitigate weather-induced visual
impairments. We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based
methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion
models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs). Restoration strategies are
further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart
transportation environments. Lastly, to stay current with rapid advancements in
this field, we will maintain regular updates of the latest relevant papers and
their open-source implementations at

### [62] [Diagnosing Shoulder Disorders Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Consumer-Grade Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09230)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They propose HMVDx, a two-stage Multimodal LLM pipeline that uses consumer-grade videos to first recognize shoulder movements and then infer shoulder disorders, plus a new Usability Index aligned with clinical decision steps; it reportedly boosts diagnosis accuracy by 79.6% over direct end-to-end video diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, accurate shoulder disorder diagnosis is hard in resource-limited settings. There is demand for low-cost, scalable tools that can work from easily captured patient videos to support clinicians and triage.

Method: Use consumer device videos. Decompose the task into (1) action understanding and (2) disease diagnosis, handled by two MLLMs. Introduce a Usability Index reflecting the clinical pathway (action recognition → movement diagnosis → final diagnosis) to evaluate models beyond standard metrics.

Result: HMVDx achieves substantially higher accuracy—reported as a 79.6% improvement—compared with a single-step direct video diagnosis approach, suggesting better utility of task decomposition for medical video understanding.

Conclusion: Task-separating MLLMs and an end-to-end clinical-pathway-based metric can improve practical diagnostic performance for shoulder disorders from low-cost videos, indicating promise for scalable medical applications and guiding future MLLM research in medical video understanding.

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They build a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification and show that current open-source VLMs, despite being heavy and slower, are less accurate than smaller purpose-built models but are more robust to image perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The community is increasingly using general-purpose VLMs for privacy prediction without a standardized evaluation, potentially overstating their capability and overlooking the strong performance of specialized models. A fair, systematic comparison is missing.

Method: Create a zero-shot benchmark for image privacy classification. Evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs (per a privacy benchmark) with task-aligned prompts, and compare them against established vision-only and multimodal specialized methods on accuracy, efficiency (parameters/inference speed), and robustness to image perturbations.

Result: VLMs underperform specialized smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy and are more resource-intensive (higher parameter counts, slower inference). However, VLMs exhibit greater robustness to image perturbations.

Conclusion: As of now, generic VLMs are not the best choice for image privacy classification if accuracy and efficiency are the priorities; specialized models remain superior. VLMs’ robustness is a promising property, suggesting future work on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or hybrid systems to combine accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

### [64] [Hallucination Filtering in Radiology Vision-Language Models Using Discrete Semantic Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09256)
*Patrick Wienholt,Sophie Caselitz,Robert Siepmann,Philipp Bruners,Keno Bressem,Christiane Kuhl,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sampling a black‑box VLM multiple times per question and measuring discrete semantic entropy (DSE) of the answer set lets you flag and filter questions likely to elicit hallucinations, substantially boosting accuracy on the retained cases in radiologic VQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical use of VLMs is hampered by hallucinations and unreliable answers, especially in high‑stakes radiology. There is a need for a black‑box, model‑agnostic, lightweight way to detect when a model’s response is likely untrustworthy, without access to logits or retraining.

Method: Two public datasets were used: VQA‑Med 2019 (500 images with short answers) and a diagnostic radiology set (206 studies across CT/MRI/X‑ray/angiography). For each image‑question pair, GPT‑4o and GPT‑4.1 were sampled 15 times at temperature 1.0. Semantically equivalent answers were clustered via bidirectional entailment checks; DSE was computed from the cluster frequency distribution. Baseline accuracy used low‑temperature (0.1) answers. Questions with high DSE (>0.6 or >0.3) were filtered out, and accuracy was recomputed on the remaining set. Uncertainty was quantified via bootstrap CIs with Bonferroni‑corrected significance (p<.004).

Result: Across 706 pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% (GPT‑4o) and 54.8% (GPT‑4.1). After filtering high‑entropy questions at DSE>0.3, accuracy on retained items increased to 76.3% for GPT‑4o (retained 334/706, ~47%) and 63.8% for GPT‑4.1 (retained 499/706, ~71%), both p<.001. Improvements were seen across both datasets and largely remained significant after correction. Results imply DSE correlates with error/hallucination risk.

Conclusion: DSE provides a practical, black‑box hallucination detector by quantifying semantic inconsistency across sampled answers. Filtering by DSE materially improves diagnostic VQA accuracy on the accepted subset, offering a deployable risk‑management strategy for clinical VLMs, at the cost of reduced coverage and added sampling overhead.

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for

from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,

inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern

for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Method: Benchmark GLiNER-BioMed on BioASQ Task 6; introduce a targeted dictionary-based post-processing step to relabel entities prone to confusion; compare baseline vs. post-processed performance on development and blind test sets; briefly explore Conditional Random Fields as an alternative method.

Result: Post-processing increased micro F1 on the development set from 0.79 to 0.83 but decreased the blind test micro F1 from 0.79 to 0.77, underperforming the baseline on held-out data.

Conclusion: Dictionary-driven corrections can overfit to development distributions and fail to generalize. Robust BioNER improvements likely require context-aware or learned constraints and stronger validation (e.g., cross-validation, better lexicon curation, or hybrid modeling) to ensure real-world applicability.

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

### [95] [Less Diverse, Less Safe: The Indirect But Pervasive Risk of Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08592)
*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RefDiv shows that reducing candidate diversity in Test-Time Scaling (TTS) reliably increases unsafe outputs across models and strategies, revealing a general vulnerability that existing safety filters often miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTS methods assume that exploring diverse candidate responses improves reliability and safety. The authors question this premise and investigate whether lowering diversity itself can induce safety failures.

Method: Introduce RefDiv, a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol that curtails variation among candidate generations, then evaluate its effect as a diagnostic attack across four open-source LLMs (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two TTS strategies (MCTS, Best-of-N), and test transfer to closed-source models (OpenAI o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro). Compare against high-intent adversarial prompts and assess detectability with safety classifiers (Llama-Guard, OpenAI Moderation API).

Result: Constrained diversity reliably increases the rate of unsafe outputs under TTS; the effect often exceeds that of high-adversarial-intent prompts, transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models, and is largely undetected by common safety guardrails.

Conclusion: TTS pipelines possess a diversity-driven failure mode: modest reductions in candidate variability can markedly degrade safety. Robust TTS should account for diversity sensitivity, and new defenses are needed to detect and withstand diversity-targeted stress tests like RefDiv.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [96] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAREN-CTC fuses multi-layer SSL speech features with cross-attention and CTC-based temporal alignment to better capture sparse depressive cues, achieving state-of-the-art F1 on DAIC-WOZ (0.81) and MODMA (0.82).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDD struggles with extracting stable, meaningful features from sparse and heterogeneous depression signals. Existing methods typically use only one SSL layer (often the last), which overfits and ignores the hierarchical information across layers, limiting generalization and sensitivity to subtle cues.

Method: Propose HAREN-CTC: (1) Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering to reorganize multi-layer SSL (e.g., WavLM) representations into complementary embeddings; (2) Cross-Modal Fusion using cross-attention to model inter-layer dependencies; trained in a multitask framework with a CTC loss to enable alignment-aware learning from sparse temporal supervision and track irregular depressive speech patterns. Evaluated under an upper-bound split and a five-fold CV generalization setting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art macro F1: 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on MODMA, outperforming prior SDD methods across both evaluation settings.

Conclusion: Leveraging the full hierarchy of SSL features with cross-attention and CTC improves robustness and temporal sensitivity for SDD, mitigating overfitting and enhancing generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

### [97] [Systematic Diagnosis of Brittle Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08595)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce a fine-grained framework to evaluate mathematical reasoning by extracting step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5 on GSM8K and using a stronger model (gpt-4o-mini) to categorize errors and cluster sentences into emergent reasoning “modes.” It reveals nonhuman brittleness: excellent on procedural calculation, weak on combinatorial reasoning with constraints, offering a roadmap for targeted capability development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Move beyond coarse benchmark accuracy to understand what kinds of mathematical reasoning current LLMs truly master or fail at, and to diagnose specific failure modes needed for safer, more reliable applications.

Method: 1) Generate structured reasoning traces from gpt-3.5-turbo on GSM8K. 2) Use gpt-4o-mini as an analyst to label error types and perform unsupervised clustering of reasoning sentences to discover emergent reasoning modes. 3) Quantify performance per mode to build a cognitive profile.

Result: Discovered distinct reasoning modes. The model performs near-perfectly on procedural/sequential calculations but performs poorly on combinatorial reasoning with restrictions. This yields a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness profile and quantified reliability per reasoning skill.

Conclusion: Granular, mode-level evaluation exposes specific strengths and weaknesses in mathematical reasoning, enabling targeted improvements and informing the design of more reliable systems and future benchmarks that assess reasoning skills rather than only end-task accuracy.

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

### [98] [Confidence, Not Perplexity: A Better Metric for the Creative Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08596)
*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce a reference-free Confidence Score (CS), derived from a model’s output probability distribution, to evaluate LLM generations with less bias against creative/novel text than fluency-based metrics like self-perplexity. On GPT‑4o‑mini, CS prefers novel responses more often and discriminates task difficulty levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluency/self-perplexity metrics systematically penalize low-likelihood (creative) generations, leading to underestimation of quality when novelty is desired. A metric is needed that preserves fluency assessment while being less biased against creativity and sensitive to task difficulty.

Method: Define a Confidence Score from the model’s own output probability distribution. Evaluate on 99 creative prompts with GPT‑4o‑mini by comparing how often metrics prefer novel responses. Assess CS’s ability to separate easy/medium/hard tasks via confidence intervals of scores.

Result: Fluency-based metrics prefer novel responses in 0% of cases; CS prefers them in 19% (95% CI for the difference: [11.1%, 27.3%]). CS yields non-overlapping confidence intervals across easy, medium, and hard tasks, indicating discrimination of task difficulty.

Conclusion: CS reduces creativity bias relative to traditional fluency/self-perplexity metrics while maintaining evaluative utility, offering a more balanced, reference-free assessment for modern LLM outputs and task difficulty.

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

### [99] [Recover-LoRA: Data-Free Accuracy Recovery of Degraded Language Models via Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08600)
*Devleena Das,Rajeev Patwari,Ashish Sirasao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA adds small, selective LoRA adapters trained via synthetic-data logit distillation to realign degraded small language models with their full‑precision counterparts, recovering 5–17% accuracy across MHA and GQA architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment-time optimizations (quantization, pruning, datatype/format conversion, export/serialization) can degrade model accuracy. Prior work largely targets robust quantization; the authors aim for a lightweight, dataset-agnostic method that can recover from any weight degradation source, including improper serialization.

Method: Use the original full-precision model as a teacher and the degraded model as a student. Generate synthetic prompts, collect teacher logits, and train LoRA adapters inserted on selected layers of the degraded model using logit distillation to align its outputs to the teacher. Layer selection keeps overhead low; method is architecture-agnostic (MHA, GQA) and does not require real task data.

Result: Across diverse small language models and evaluation datasets, Recover-LoRA restores 5–17% absolute accuracy on both MHA and GQA models.

Conclusion: A practical, lightweight, and data-agnostic post-hoc recovery technique: LoRA adapters learned from synthetic-data distillation can effectively undo various deployment-induced degradations, offering a general recovery path with minimal compute and storage overhead.

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

### [100] [Mnemosyne: An Unsupervised, Human-Inspired Long-Term Memory Architecture for Edge-Based LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08601)
*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne is an unsupervised, human-inspired long‑term memory system for edge-based LLMs that uses a graph store, filtering, commit/prune policies, probabilistic recall with temporal decay/refresh, and a compact core summary; it outperforms standard RAG and popular memory baselines on longitudinal healthcare dialogues and LoCoMo benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural, realistic dialogue requires persistent memory, but current LLM approaches either expand context windows or rely on static retrieval pipelines that are too heavy or brittle on edge devices. In longitudinal settings like healthcare, naive retrieval fails when conversations are repetitive, semantically similar, but temporally distinct. The authors aim to provide effective, lightweight, and temporally aware memory for on-device assistants.

Method: The architecture stores interactions in a graph-structured memory. It applies modular substance and redundancy filters to decide what to keep, uses commit and pruning mechanisms to manage growth, and employs probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh to mimic human memory dynamics. A concentrated core summary is derived from a fixed-length subset of the graph to capture enduring traits (e.g., user personality, post-recovery goals). The system is designed to be unsupervised and edge-compatible, avoiding heavy retrieval pipelines.

Result: In blind human evaluations on longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne achieves a 65.8% win rate for realism and long‑term memory versus a RAG baseline at 31.1%. It attains highest LoCoMo scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval among methods sharing the same backbone, and an average overall LoCoMo score of 54.6%, second-highest overall, outperforming Mem0 and OpenAI baselines.

Conclusion: Human-inspired, unsupervised memory mechanisms can deliver better factual recall, temporal reasoning, and more natural responses on edge devices. Mnemosyne’s edge-compatibility and transferable design suggest practical viability for long-term, domain-specific assistants, especially in healthcare.

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

### [101] [Human Texts Are Outliers: Detecting LLM-generated Texts via Out-of-distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08602)
*Cong Zeng,Shengkun Tang,Yuanzhou Chen,Zhiqiang Shen,Wenchao Yu,Xujiang Zhao,Haifeng Chen,Wei Cheng,Zhiqiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reframes LLM-generated text detection as an OOD problem by treating machine outputs as in-distribution and human texts as outliers; uses one-class and energy-based methods to achieve strong, generalizable detection across datasets, languages, attacks, and unseen models/domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary classifiers assume a coherent distribution of human writing and tend to overfit to observed data, leading to poor cross-domain/model generalization. Human text is inherently diverse and not well captured by limited samples, so a binary setup mischaracterizes the task.

Method: Model the detection task as OOD: train on machine-generated texts as in-distribution and flag human-authored texts as out-of-distribution. Implement one-class learning (DeepSVDD, HRN) and score-based energy methods to learn compact representations and scoring functions for ID data; use thresholds on scores for detection.

Result: Across multiple datasets, the OOD-based approach outperforms binary classifiers. On the DeepFake dataset it reports 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with 8.9% FPR95, and maintains robustness in multilingual settings, under adversarial attacks, and on texts from unseen models and domains.

Conclusion: Formulating AI-text detection as OOD detection improves robustness and generalization. One-class and energy-based learners provide effective detectors when trained on machine outputs. The approach appears broadly applicable; code and pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

*Deshui Yu,Yizhi Wang,Saihui Jin,Taojie Zhu,Fanyi Zeng,Wen Qian,Zirui Huang,Jingli Ouyang,Jiameng Li,Zhen Song,Tian Guan,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: YpathRAG is a pathology-focused retrieval-augmented generation system that builds a large pathology vector database, uses hybrid dense+sparse retrieval with an evidence-judging LLM module, and delivers major gains in retrieval recall and QA accuracy on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General LLMs hallucinate in specialized, high-stakes domains like pathology. Prior domain-specific fine-tuning neither broadens accessible knowledge nor guarantees evidence-grounded answers, motivating a retrieval-centric, evidence-checked approach.

Method: Construct a pathology vector database spanning 28 subfields and 1.53M paragraphs. Propose YpathRAG with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense retrieval plus vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the retrieval–judgment–generation loop. Release two benchmarks: YpathR (retrieval) and YpathQA-M (300 hard QA items).

Result: On YpathR, YpathRAG achieves 98.64% Recall@5, a +23 percentage point improvement over baseline. On YpathQA-M, it boosts accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by an average of 9.0% and up to 15.6%.

Conclusion: Hybrid retrieval with evidence judgment substantially improves retrieval quality and factual reliability in pathology QA. The framework and released benchmarks offer a scalable, interpretable paradigm for pathology-oriented RAG systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

### [103] [LatentBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models through Latent Space Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08604)
*Raffaele Mura,Giorgio Piras,Kamilė Lukošiūtė,Maura Pintor,Amin Karbasi,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LatentBreak is a white-box jailbreak that crafts low-perplexity, natural-sounding adversarial prompts via semantic word substitutions selected in latent space, enabling evasion of perplexity-based defenses and outperforming prior jailbreak methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated jailbreaks often rely on high-perplexity suffixes or long templates to coerce restricted outputs, which can be detected by simple perplexity filters on the prompt. The paper seeks a more natural, undetectable attack that preserves user intent while bypassing such defenses.

Method: Introduce LatentBreak, a white-box optimization that substitutes words in the original prompt with semantically equivalent alternatives. It chooses substitutions that minimize the distance between the adversarial prompt’s latent representation and that of benign requests, yielding natural, short, low-perplexity prompts instead of high-perplexity suffixes/templates.

Result: Across multiple safety-aligned LLMs, LatentBreak produces shorter prompts with lower perplexity and achieves higher jailbreak success when perplexity-based filters are applied, outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms.

Conclusion: Perplexity-based filtering is insufficient against adaptive, natural-language jailbreaks. By leveraging latent-space semantics, attackers can evade such defenses, indicating the need for stronger, semantics-aware safety mechanisms beyond simple perplexity thresholds.

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

### [104] [Toward a Safer Web: Multilingual Multi-Agent LLMs for Mitigating Adversarial Misinformation Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08605)
*Nouar Aldahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Studies how adversarial content transformations (cross-language switching/translation, length inflation before summarization, and MCQ reformatting) affect misinformation detection, and proposes a multilingual, multi‑agent RAG-based LLM framework deployable as a web plugin to defend against them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation rapidly spreads online and harms discourse and decision-making. Prior adversarial work exists, but the specific transformations examined here—language switching with translation, query-length inflation, and MCQ reformatting—have not been systematically analyzed. There is also a need for practically deployable, robust detectors.

Method: Defines and tests three families of attacks: (1) language switching across English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese followed by translation; (2) length inflation before summarization; (3) reformulation into multiple-choice questions. Introduces a multilingual, multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and positions it for plugin-based deployment on web platforms.

Result: Demonstrates that an AI-driven, multilingual, multi-agent RAG framework can be integrated as a web plugin and can address diverse adversarial transformations; highlights feasibility of real-world deployment. (No specific quantitative results are provided in the abstract.)

Conclusion: Robust, multilingual, RAG-enhanced, multi-agent LLM systems are a viable path for defending online factual integrity against varied adversarial transformations, and plugin-based deployment enables practical integration into real-world platforms.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on digital platforms threatens public
discourse, emotional stability, and decision-making. While prior work has
explored various adversarial attacks in misinformation detection, the specific
transformations examined in this paper have not been systematically studied. In
particular, we investigate language-switching across English, French, Spanish,
Arabic, Hindi, and Chinese, followed by translation. We also study query length
inflation preceding summarization and structural reformatting into
multiple-choice questions. In this paper, we present a multilingual,
multi-agent large language model framework with retrieval-augmented generation
that can be deployed as a web plugin into online platforms. Our work
underscores the importance of AI-driven misinformation detection in
safeguarding online factual integrity against diverse attacks, while showcasing
the feasibility of plugin-based deployment for real-world web applications.

### [105] [Centering Emotion Hotspots: Multimodal Local-Global Fusion and Cross-Modal Alignment for Emotion Recognition in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08606)
*Yu Liu,Hanlei Shi,Haoxun Li,Yuqing Sun,Yuxuan Ding,Linlin Gong,Leyuan Qu,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hotspot-centric multimodal ERC: detect per-utterance emotion hotspots in text, audio, and video; fuse them via Hotspot-Gated Fusion (HGF), align with a routed Mixture-of-Aligners (MoA), and encode conversation structure with a cross-modal graph—yielding consistent gains on ERC benchmarks with ablations validating HGF and MoA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC is challenging because emotional cues are sparse, brief, and often out of sync across modalities. Conventional fusion can dilute these signals and suffer from misalignment. The work seeks a model that focuses on salient spans, aligns modalities effectively, and preserves conversational context.

Method: A unified pipeline: (1) detect per-utterance emotion hotspots in each modality; (2) combine hotspot and global features through Hotspot-Gated Fusion (HGF) to emphasize salient evidence while retaining context; (3) align modalities using a routed Mixture-of-Aligners (MoA) that selects among alignment experts; (4) model conversational dependencies with a cross-modal graph.

Result: Across standard ERC benchmarks, the method consistently outperforms strong baselines. Ablation studies show that both HGF and MoA materially contribute to the gains.

Conclusion: Reframing ERC around hotspot detection mitigates cross-modal misalignment and protects context, improving multimodal fusion. This hotspot-centric perspective may inform broader multimodal learning beyond ERC.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce MMA-ASIA, a multilingual, multimodal benchmark and evaluation protocol to rigorously test LLMs’ culturally grounded understanding and reasoning across Asian languages and modalities, plus tools to detect shortcut learning and analyze failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs’ multimodal reasoning degrades outside Western, high-resource settings. There is a lack of rigorous, culturally grounded evaluation—especially for Asia—spanning multiple languages and modalities. The authors aim to quantify cultural-awareness gaps and diagnose why models fail across languages and modalities.

Method: - Build MMA-ASIA: 27k human-curated multiple-choice questions across 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, aligned at input level across text, image (VQA), and speech; 79% require multi-step, culturally grounded reasoning.
- Propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol: (i) cross-country disparities, (ii) cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural knowledge generalization, (v) grounding validity.
- Introduce a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module to detect shortcut learning by verifying that required cultural knowledge supports correct answers.
- Use comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) to probe divergences across languages/modalities and study cross-modal transfer.

Result: Provide the first benchmark aligned across text, image, and speech for Asian cultural evaluation; demonstrate measurable disparities and inconsistencies across countries, languages, and modalities; reveal shortcut learning; and show that VPR and attention tracing expose why and where models diverge. These yield actionable diagnostics for improving culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: MMA-ASIA and its 5D protocol enable rigorous, grounded testing of cultural awareness in multimodal LLMs for Asian contexts. The grounding validator and VPR help detect shortcuts and analyze failure modes, guiding development of more culturally robust, cross-lingual and cross-modal systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

### [107] [GraphGhost: Tracing Structures Behind Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08613)
*Xinnan Dai,Kai Guo,Chung-Hsiang Lo,Shenglai Zeng,Jiayuan Ding,Dongsheng Luo,Subhabrata Mukherjee,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphGhost models LLM neuron activations and their propagation as graphs, enabling graph-algorithm-based analysis (e.g., PageRank) that uncovers reasoning structure and shows that editing key neuron nodes can collapse reasoning, thus offering a practical route to analyze and intervene in LLM reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong reasoning, but the structural mechanisms behind these abilities are poorly understood. The authors seek an interpretable, unified, and model-agnostic way to explain how sequential inputs yield structurally consistent outputs and to enable principled interventions.

Method: Represent neuron activations and signal flows inside LLMs as a graph (GraphGhost). Apply graph algorithms—such as PageRank—to characterize structural semantics and reasoning properties. Identify and target highly influential/activated neuron nodes, then perform structural interventions to test causal effects on logical flow and semantics.

Result: Graph analysis reveals both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across datasets. Intervening on key neuron nodes induces reasoning collapse, altering logical flow and semantic understanding, validating their structural importance.

Conclusion: A graph-based view of internal activations provides interpretable leverage over LLM reasoning. GraphGhost serves as a tool to analyze, diagnose, and causally intervene on reasoning processes, advancing understanding of their structural foundations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

### [108] [Gender Bias in Large Language Models for Healthcare: Assignment Consistency and Clinical Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08614)
*Mingxuan Liu,Yuhe Ke,Wentao Zhu,Mayli Mertens,Yilin Ning,Jingchi Liao,Chuan Hong,Daniel Shu Wei Ting,Yifan Peng,Danielle S. Bitterman,Marcus Eng Hock Ong,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Assigning gendered personas to LLMs leaves diagnoses mostly stable but produces substantial, sometimes asymmetric, shifts in how models judge the relevance/necessity of patient gender—revealing a hidden, persona-induced bias with clinical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gender affects clinician behavior and outcomes; if LLMs are used as clinicians/educators, they may mirror or amplify gender-related biases. The study probes whether the LLM’s assigned gendered identity alters diagnostic outputs and meta-judgments about patient gender information.

Method: NEJM Challenge case studies were posed to multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs under three persona conditions (female, male, unspecified). The authors compared cross-persona consistency for (a) final diagnoses and (b) judgments about whether patient gender is relevant or necessary for diagnosis.

Result: Across models, diagnoses were relatively consistent regardless of persona. However, all models showed large cross-persona inconsistencies in judging the relevance/necessity of patient gender—especially relevance—with some models exhibiting systematic female–male disparities.

Conclusion: LLM persona gender introduces an underrecognized bias channel affecting clinical reasoning about patient gender, potentially undermining reliability and equity. Routine checks for identity-assignment consistency are recommended before deploying LLMs in clinical settings.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

### [109] [Iterative LLM-Based Generation and Refinement of Distracting Conditions in Math Word Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08615)
*Kaiqi Yang,Hang Li,Yucheng Chu,Zitao Liu,Mi Tian,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They propose an LLM-driven, iterative framework to add realistic distracting conditions to math word problems while preserving the original solutions, enabling robust evaluation of LLM reasoning without costly manual re-annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs’ math reasoning degrades sharply when problems include distracting or excessive information, yet existing datasets with such distractions are scarce, low-quality, and often trivial or out-of-context. Adding distractions typically changes solutions, demanding heavy manual verification. A better way is needed to create credible, challenging benchmarks with minimal human effort.

Method: An iterative prompting framework guides LLMs to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels. The prompts elicit meaningful distracting conditions and self-suggested refinements, while explicitly constraining generations so that the original reasoning and final answer remain valid (solution invariance). This reduces or removes the need for new answers/solutions and is easy to deploy at scale.

Result: The framework efficiently produces MWPs with high-quality, realistic distractions and preserves shared solutions with the originals, substantially cutting data-generation and checking effort and improving benchmark credibility. (No quantitative metrics are provided in the abstract.)

Conclusion: Automating the generation of solution-preserving distractions yields scalable, high-quality datasets that better stress-test LLM robustness in mathematical reasoning without incurring heavy manual re-annotation.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

### [110] [LLMs Show Surface-Form Brittleness Under Paraphrase Stress Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08616)
*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Paraphrasing benchmark questions exposes inflated LLM scores: both Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct lose notable accuracy on paraphrased ARC-Easy/Challenge items, indicating brittle generalization and possible contamination/shortcut reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmark accuracy can be misleading due to test-item memorization and surface-form shortcuts; the authors seek a simple way to probe true generalization rather than recall of seen or near-duplicate items.

Method: Create paraphrased versions of ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge questions; apply a cleaning step to ensure semantic preservation; standardize inference by controlling decoding and enforcing multiple-choice output; compare model accuracy on original vs. paraphrased items for Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct; compute the accuracy gap.

Result: Across both models and ARC splits, accuracy drops meaningfully on paraphrased items relative to originals, demonstrating sensitivity to surface-form changes.

Conclusion: Paraphrasing is an effective, lightweight protocol to stress-test generalization and detect benchmark inflation from contamination/shortcuts. Observed drops suggest current 7B instruct models overfit to surface forms; evaluations should include paraphrase variants to better measure robust reasoning.

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

### [111] [JAI-1: A Thai-Centric Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08620)
*Attapol T. Rutherford,Jullajak Karnjanaekarin,Narongkorn Panitsrisit,Pontakorn Trakuekul,Sumana Sumanakul,Natchanon Pollertlam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JAI-1 is a 75B-parameter Thai-centric LLM built by upscaling a smaller English model and using the added capacity to integrate Thai knowledge. Trained on 1.5T tokens (300B Thai) and >600K instruction examples, it outperforms Typhoon2-70B on Thai benchmarks, preserving general intelligence while specializing in Thai.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Thai models mainly fine-tune off-the-shelf LLMs without architectural change, risking catastrophic forgetting and conflicts between general and Thai-specific knowledge. The authors seek a way to add rich Thai competence without eroding prior capabilities and to create a scalable, distinct architecture.

Method: Upscale a smaller, strong English open-source LLM by expanding its parameter space, then use the newly added capacity to systematically inject Thai-language knowledge. Pretraining on 1.5T tokens (300B Thai) is followed by supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning using >600K instruction examples. The architecture is made distinct to enable future scalable enhancements.

Result: The final 75B model surpasses Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks (IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, JAI-Hall-Bench), while maintaining general intelligence from the base model.

Conclusion: Targeted upscaling with capacity expansion effectively integrates Thai knowledge without degrading general abilities, yielding a strong, scalable, and distinct Thai-centric LLM that sets a new performance bar on Thai evaluations.

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

### [112] [From Simulation to Strategy: Automating Personalized Interaction Planning for Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08621)
*Wen-Yu Chang,Tzu-Hung Huang,Chih-Ho Chen,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sales dialogue agents work better when tailored to user personas; occupation is the strongest predictor of conversational intent. A simple occupation-conditioned strategy yields shorter, more successful sales dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic dialogue models need realistic, profile-rich user simulators to fine-tune conversation strategies. The authors seek to understand which user attributes most affect sales dialogue outcomes and how to leverage them.

Method: Analyze a sales-oriented agent interacting with simulated users differing by age, gender, and occupation. Measure performance and intent patterns, then design a lightweight strategy that conditions intent prioritization on occupation.

Result: Age and gender modestly influence overall performance, but occupation drives the largest differences in conversational intent. The occupation-conditioned strategy achieves shorter conversations and higher success rates.

Conclusion: Rich simulator personas matter, and even simple persona-informed (especially occupation-based) strategies can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of sales dialogue systems.

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

### [113] [Text2Stories: Evaluating the Alignment Between Stakeholder Interviews and Generated User Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08622)
*Francesco Dente,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Papotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2Stories proposes a source-grounded way to evaluate how well user stories reflect stakeholder needs by aligning interview transcripts to stories and scoring correctness and completeness; an LLM-based matcher attains strong performance (0.86 macro-F1) across four datasets and enables fair comparisons of human vs. generated stories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating whether user stories—especially those generated by LLMs—faithfully capture stakeholder needs is labor-intensive and lacks scalable, source-grounded metrics.

Method: Define a text-to-story alignment task and metrics: correctness (fraction of stories supported by the transcript) and completeness (fraction of transcript covered by at least one story). Segment transcripts into chunks and cast alignment as a chunk–story matching problem, using an LLM-based matcher (with embeddings for blocking).

Result: Across four datasets, the LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out annotations; embedding-only approaches underperform but effectively reduce search space. The metrics enable comparisons across different sets of stories (e.g., human vs. LLM-generated).

Conclusion: Text2Stories provides a scalable, source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria, enabling automated, quantitative assessment of requirement correctness and completeness and facilitating comparison of story sets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

### [114] [PARSE: LLM Driven Schema Optimization for Reliable Entity Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08623)
*Anubhav Shrimal,Aryan Jain,Soumyajit Chowdhury,Promod Yenigalla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE reframes JSON schemas as adaptable NLU contracts and introduces ARCHITECT (schema optimization with backward-compatible code generation via RELAY) and SCOPE (reflection-based extraction with static/LLM guardrails) to boost LLM-driven information extraction, yielding large accuracy gains (up to 64.7% on SWDE), 10% end-to-end improvements across models, and 92% error reduction on first retry without hurting latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static, human-oriented JSON schemas used directly with LLMs cause ambiguity, hallucinations, and unreliable extraction. The authors posit schemas encode implicit language understanding rules that LLMs can interpret and refine to improve structured extraction for Software 3.0 agents.

Method: Introduce PARSE with two components: (1) ARCHITECT autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM consumption while preserving backward compatibility via RELAY (an integrated code-generation layer); (2) SCOPE performs reflection-based extraction combining static constraints and LLM guardrails. Evaluate on SGD, SWDE, and internal retail conversations.

Result: Up to 64.7% extraction accuracy improvement on SWDE; ~10% combined framework gains across models; 92% reduction in extraction errors on first retry; maintains practical latency.

Conclusion: Treating schemas as dynamic, optimizable contracts and pairing them with reflective, guardrailed extraction substantially improves LLM-based structured information extraction, stabilizing agent behavior without major latency costs.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

### [115] [Do LLMs Know They Are Being Tested? Evaluation Awareness and Incentive-Sensitive Failures in GPT-OSS-20B](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08624)
*Nisar Ahmed,Muhammad Imran Zaman,Gulshan Saleem,Ali Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation-scented prompts inflate visible reasoning and formatting without reliably improving accuracy, risking misleading benchmark gains. The authors provide an A/B framework and guidance to align evaluations with deployable, contract-bound outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks often use rubric-style, reasoning-explicit prompts unlike real deployments that require terse, answer-only responses. This “evaluation scent” may overstate capability and misalign measurement with production needs.

Method: Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), the authors run six paired A/B scenarios that keep task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High). Tasks include deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) rubric headers. Deterministic validators measure accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, CoT length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. They release prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, and scripts.

Result: Evaluation framing consistently increases CoT length (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy improvements. For structured outputs, it improves superficial wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, lists) but not regex-validated substantive content. Incentive wording shifts error profiles: praising caution modestly boosts accuracy at high reasoning and lowers wrong-but-confident errors; praising competence produces terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these effects and can reduce accuracy at higher reasoning depth, suggesting multilingual parity risks.

Conclusion: “Evaluation scent” can inflate benchmark scores without true capability gains and may degrade deployability (e.g., answer-only compliance). The authors advocate neutral or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, reporting style deltas, confidence/error governance, and multilingual dashboards. They provide a reproducible A/B framework to ensure that observed gains reflect real, deployable capability rather than prompt-framing artifacts.

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

### [116] [From What to Why: Thought-Space Recommendation with Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08626)
*Prosenjit Biswas,Pervez Shaik,Abhinav Thorat,Ravi Kolla,Niranjan Pedanekar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PULSE trains small language models to turn natural-language rationales into supervised signals, learning a cross-domain “Thought Space” that jointly captures what users do and why—yielding strong, transferable recommendation performance at lower cost than LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs improve recommendation via reasoning but are costly to deploy; SLMs are efficient yet their reasoning for recsys is underused. Existing methods treat rationales as mere descriptions rather than learning signals and lack a common semantic space across domains.

Method: Introduce PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings): generate SLM rationales for interactions and use them as direct supervision alongside user-item histories to jointly model actions (what) and semantic drivers (why). Treat rationales as first-class training signals to learn a shared, cross-domain “Thought Space” of latent semantic embeddings, without relying on LLM distillation.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks, PULSE outperforms ID-based, CF, and LLM-based sequential recommenders; it transfers better in cross-domain recommendation and performs strongly on reasoning-oriented QA. The learned embeddings are more robust and generalizable.

Conclusion: Rationale-supervised SLMs can deliver reasoning-aware, efficient recommendation. By aligning behaviors with their semantic causes in a shared Thought Space, PULSE achieves superior accuracy and transfer while avoiding LLM inference costs; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

### [117] [ExPO-HM: Learning to Explain-then-Detect for Hateful Meme Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08630)
*Jingbiao Mei,Mingsheng Sun,Jinghong Chen,Pengda Qin,Yuhong Li,Da Chen,Bill Byrne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExPO-HM is an explain-then-detect training framework for hateful meme moderation that couples SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as a reasoning reward/metric, achieving state-of-the-art results and sizable F1 gains over GRPO and DPO baselines while producing interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hateful meme detection needs more than binary alarms: moderators require context and explanations (targets, attack types). Existing Explain-then-Detect systems underperform SFT, and binary reward signals don’t adequately guide reasoning; models rarely hypothesize policy-relevant cues. A method is needed that improves both accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Train an LMM with an Explain-then-Detect pipeline inspired by human annotators: (1) SFT warmup, (2) GRPO with curriculum learning to progressively shape reasoning, and (3) use Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) both as a metric and as a training reward to encourage high-quality, policy-relevant explanations before making the binary decision.

Result: Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM delivers SOTA on binary detection, fine-grained classification, and reasoning quality, with up to 15% and 17% F1 improvements over GRPO and DPO baselines, respectively.

Conclusion: Shifting from pure binary detection to explanation-driven training with appropriate reward shaping (CDE) and curriculum improves meme moderation by yielding accurate, interpretable, and actionable outputs.

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

### [118] [Next Semantic Scale Prediction via Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08632)
*Cai Zhou,Chenyu Wang,Dinghuai Zhang,Shangyuan Tong,Yifei Wang,Stephen Bates,Tommi Jaakkola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HDLM is a hierarchical, discrete diffusion approach to language modeling that diffuses tokens from fine to coarse semantic levels in the forward process and reverses to recover detail, yielding lower perplexity than prior baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve discrete diffusion language modeling by explicitly modeling multi-scale semantics, provide a general framework that subsumes MDLM, and achieve better perplexity and generation quality with principled training (closed-form ELBO).

Method: Construct a hierarchical vocabulary where fine-grained tokens map surjectively to coarse-grained ancestors. Forward diffusion stochastically moves tokens upward (more abstract) per a scheduler; reverse denoising predicts progressively finer semantic levels (time-varying next semantic-scale prediction). Derive closed-form diffusion ELBO; implement flexibly so HDLM includes MDLM as a special case; introduce practical training techniques informed by the theory.

Result: Across extensive text generation experiments, HDLM achieves consistently lower validation perplexity and generative perplexity than baselines (including MDLM).

Conclusion: Hierarchical, multi-scale discrete diffusion provides an effective and general mechanism for language modeling; the proposed HDLM framework is theoretically grounded (closed-form ELBO), practical to train, and empirically superior to existing baselines.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

### [119] [Upfront Chain-of-Thought: A Cooperative Framework for Chain-of-Thought Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08647)
*Chengzhengxu Li,Xiaoming Liu,Zhaohan Zhang,Shaochu Zhang,Shengchao Liu,Guoxin Ma,Yu Lan,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UCoT compresses Chain-of-Thought by using a small “compressor” model to produce upfront thought embeddings that a larger “executor” model uses to reason with much shorter outputs, cutting tokens while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Chain-of-Thought improves LLM reasoning but causes high latency and cost. Prior compression approaches rely on brittle prompt engineering or external compressed-CoT datasets that often drop crucial reasoning details. The goal is to automate compression without losing reasoning power.

Method: Two-stage cooperative framework: (1) Train a small compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning signals for the large executor, replacing hand-crafted prompts. (2) Optimize the executor with a reward mechanism to leverage these embeddings and produce short reasoning that still reaches correct answers.

Result: Across experiments, UCoT preserves strong reasoning while significantly shortening CoT. On GSM8K with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, token usage is reduced by ~50% and accuracy surpasses prior SOTA by 3.08%.

Conclusion: Upfront CoT automates CoT compression via learned thought embeddings, achieving faster and cheaper reasoning without sacrificing—and even improving—performance. Code and data are provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

### [120] [Formalizing Style in Personal Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08649)
*Gustave Cortal,Alain Finkel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces a computational framework that formalizes narrative style as patterns of linguistic choices, extracted with language models and interpreted through functional linguistics to link style with psychological states; validated on dream reports and a PTSD case study showing dominance of verbal over mental processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personal narratives encode subjective experience through stylistic choices, but there is no systematic, formal, and computational method to analyze these choices or connect them to psychological interpretation.

Method: Integrate systemic functional linguistics (processes, participants, circumstances) with automated sequence pattern extraction using language models; apply to hundreds of dream narratives and a focused PTSD veteran case study to quantify stylistic patterns and relate them to psychological observations.

Result: Automatic extraction of linguistic features is feasible; analysis uncovers distinctive stylistic patterns, notably in the PTSD case where verbal processes outweigh mental processes, suggesting specific psychological dynamics reflected in language use.

Conclusion: Formalizing style as patterned linguistic choices enables scalable, psychologically meaningful analysis of personal narratives; the findings illustrate how stylistic features can signal psychological states, supporting both research and potential clinical applications.

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

### [121] [A Novel Framework for Augmenting Rating Scale Tests with LLM-Scored Text Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08663)
*Joe Watson,Ivan O'Conner,Chia-Wen Chen,Luning Sun,Fang Luo,David Stillwell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They augment traditional depression rating scales with LLM-scored free-text responses, selected via item-information metrics, yielding notably higher measurement precision and accuracy—comparable to adding 6–16 extra items—without requiring labeled data or expert rubrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard psychometric scales miss nuance in natural language and typically need labeled data or expert-defined rubrics for automated scoring. The authors aim to capture richer qualitative signals from respondents’ text to improve measurement quality while avoiding costly annotation and rubric engineering.

Method: Propose an augmented testing framework that: (1) collects free-text alongside rating-scale items; (2) uses an LLM to score text under various candidate instructions/prompts; (3) applies item-response theory (IRT) to estimate item information for each LLM-scored item; (4) selects the most informative LLM instruction-derived items; and (5) combines them with traditional items. They evaluate on a real dataset of upper secondary students (n=693) and a synthetic dataset (n=3,000), using held-out test sets to assess precision and accuracy gains.

Result: Augmented tests with LLM-scored items show statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy on held-out data. The additional information contributed by LLM items is equivalent to adding about 6.3 items in the real dataset and 16.0 items in the synthetic dataset to a 19-item baseline test.

Conclusion: LLM-derived text items can measurably enhance psychometric assessments when chosen by empirical item information, removing dependence on labeled data or complex rubrics. This provides a scalable path to incorporate transcribed natural language into traditional measures, with potential applications in clinical health and other domains.

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

### [122] [dInfer: An Efficient Inference Framework for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08666)
*Yuxin Ma,Lun Du,Lanning Wei,Kun Chen,Qian Xu,Kangyu Wang,Guofeng Feng,Guoshan Lu,Lin Liu,Xiaojing Qi,Xinyuan Zhang,Zhen Tao,Haibo Feng,Ziyun Jiang,Ying Xu,Zenan Huang,Yihong Zhuang,Haokai Xu,Jiaqi Hu,Zhenzhong Lan,Junbo Zhao,Jianguo Li,Da Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dInfer is an open-source, modular inference framework for diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) that combines algorithmic and system optimizations to deliver up to 10× speedups over prior dLLM systems and 2–3× over optimized AR baselines, without observed quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs promise inherent parallelism but lack a standardized, efficient inference stack. The community needs a general, high-performance framework that manages diffusion iterations, decoding, and KV caching to make dLLMs practical at scale.

Method: Decompose dLLM inference into four pluggable components—model, diffusion iteration manager, decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager—and introduce new algorithms within each, alongside system-level optimizations. Evaluate primarily on LLaDA-MoE across several benchmarks and report throughput on multi-GPU H800 hardware.

Result: At batch size 1, dInfer exceeds 1,100 tokens/s on HumanEval and averages >800 tokens/s across six benchmarks on 8× H800 GPUs. It achieves ~10× speedup over Fast-dLLM with similar model quality, and 2–3× speedup over an optimized AR baseline (Qwen2.5-3B with vLLM) at comparable activation size/performance.

Conclusion: A modular, optimization-rich diffusion inference stack can make dLLMs highly efficient without degrading output quality, suggesting practical viability beyond research prototypes. The implementation is open-sourced for community adoption.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

### [123] [Scaling Laws for Code: A More Data-Hungry Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08702)
*Xianzhen Luo,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Rongyi Zhang,Houyi Li,Siming Huang,YuanTao Fan,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First large-scale empirical study of code LLM scaling shows code is more data-hungry than natural language; Farseer fits outperform Chinchilla; NL data helps only under tight compute, but hurts at higher budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling laws guiding efficient training are mostly derived from natural-language corpora. Because programming code has stricter syntax and different statistics, it’s unclear whether NL-derived laws transfer, risking suboptimal allocation of model size, data, and compute for code LLMs.

Method: Run 117 training experiments covering 0.2B–3.8B parameters and 2B–128B tokens; fit and compare Chinchilla and Farseer scaling laws; run additional experiments with mixtures of code and NL to assess data-composition effects under varying compute budgets.

Result: Farseer provides a more accurate fit than Chinchilla. Code model performance scales well with increasing model size. Optimal training for code requires a higher data-to-parameter ratio than NL (i.e., code is more data-hungry). Mixing NL with code improves performance only in resource-constrained settings; at higher compute budgets, NL inclusion becomes detrimental.

Conclusion: For training code LLMs, prioritize higher token budgets per parameter compared to NL guidelines, and rely on Farseer for planning. Favor code-only data at larger compute budgets, reserving NL mixtures for low-compute regimes.

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

### [124] [Thinking Longer, Not Always Smarter: Evaluating LLM Capabilities in Hierarchical Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08710)
*Li Zhang,Matthias Grabmair,Morgan Gray,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce a formal, three-stage framework to test how well LLMs perform legal case-based reasoning using factor-based case models and a knowledge hierarchy. LLMs do fine on surface tasks, struggle with hierarchical reasoning, and fail on integrated analyses; using more computation correlates with worse answers, challenging the idea that longer reasoning always helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Case-based reasoning is central in law, but it’s unclear whether LLMs can handle the nuanced, hierarchical distinctions lawyers make when analogizing and distinguishing precedents. A principled, verifiable way to dissect and measure such reasoning is needed to assess and improve legal AI.

Method: Model cases with factual predicates (factors), organize them in a legal knowledge hierarchy, and define rules to (1) identify distinctions between cases, (2) analyze their argumentative support, and (3) assess their significance. Evaluate modern reasoning LLMs on these staged tasks, measuring accuracy and computational effort per response.

Result: High accuracy on surface-level Task 1; degraded accuracy on hierarchical Task 2 (64.82%–92.09%); very poor performance on integrated Task 3 (11.46%–33.99%). Models often spend more computation on incorrect answers than on correct ones, indicating that longer chains of reasoning do not guarantee better outcomes.

Conclusion: The framework enables fine-grained, verifiable evaluation of legal reasoning. Current LLMs show fundamental weaknesses in hierarchical and integrated legal analysis; improving methods beyond simply increasing “thinking” steps is necessary for robust, trustworthy legal AI.

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

### [125] [How Many Code and Test Cases Are Enough? Evaluating Test Cases Generation from a Binary-Matrix Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08720)
*Xianzhen Luo,Jinyang Huang,Wenzhen Zheng,Qingfu Zhu,Mingzheng Xu,Yiheng Xu,Yuantao Fan,Libo Qin,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They formalize benchmark construction for LLM-generated test evaluation via a binary code–test matrix, where matrix rank captures the minimal independent error patterns and sets an upper bound on needed tests. They propose WrongSelect, an approximation algorithm to select a maximally diverse basis of wrong codes, and build TC-Bench from millions of competitive programming submissions. TC-Bench is compact, diverse, and resists score inflation; SOTA test generators exclude only ~60% of wrong codes, revealing a substantial diagnostic gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating LLM-generated test cases is costly and unreliable: existing benchmarks inflate scores and overemphasize trivial bugs while missing rare, critical faults. The authors seek principled minimal representations—both of wrong-code behaviors and distinguishing tests—to improve evaluation fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Model code–test outcomes as a binary matrix. The matrix rank equals the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong codes) and upper-bounds the number of tests needed for full fault coverage. They pose benchmark design as finding a rank-sized, internally diverse diagnostic basis—an NP-hard selection problem—and introduce WrongSelect, an efficient approximation to pick maximally diverse wrong codes. They instantiate this on large-scale competitive programming submissions to construct TC-Bench.

Result: TC-Bench is a compact, diverse, inflation-resistant benchmark. Experiments show advanced test generation methods achieve only about 60% exclusion rates on TC-Bench, indicating limited diagnostic power. Dataset and code are publicly released.

Conclusion: A principled, rank-based framework plus the WrongSelect algorithm yields a compact yet challenging benchmark that mitigates inflation and trivial-bug bias. Results expose a significant gap in current test generation methods and provide a foundation and resources for more robust, fault-diverse evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Luoberta/TC-Bench and our code is

### [126] [How Reliable is Language Model Micro-Benchmarking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08730)
*Gregory Yauney,Shahzaib Saqib Warraich,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Micro-benchmarks with very small sample sizes often fail to preserve model rankings from full benchmarks; reliable ranking typically requires much larger samples (≈250), at which point random sampling is as strong as curated methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the time/cost of LLM evaluation by using tiny subsets, and determine whether such micro-benchmarks reliably preserve model rankings versus full benchmarks and random selection.

Method: Propose a meta-evaluation that measures pairwise rank accuracy of a micro-benchmark as a function of the true performance gap on the full benchmark. Evaluate across MMLU-Pro and BIG-bench Hard, varying subset sizes and selection strategies, including random sampling and prior curated approaches; analyze specific settings like 8B instruction-tuned models.

Result: No micro-benchmark method consistently ranks models only 3.5 pts apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 pts apart on BIG-bench Hard with small subsets. To reliably rank similarly performing models, often ~250 examples are required, where random sampling is competitive with curated selection. With 25 examples on MMLU-Pro among 8B instruction-tuned models, over half of pairwise rankings are unlikely to be preserved.

Conclusion: Very small micro-benchmarks (e.g., 10–25 items) are unreliable for ranking similar models. Reliable evaluation typically needs much larger subsets (~250), and simple random sampling can suffice. Users and developers should report rank-reliability curves, compare to random baselines, and choose subset sizes aligned with the smallest performance gaps they wish to resolve.

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

TL;DR: They propose and evaluate an LLM-based strategy to geocode compositional location references, showing it boosts accuracy and that a small fine-tuned LLM can match much larger off‑the‑shelf models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geocoding from unstructured text is widely needed, but compositional location mentions (multi-part references) are hard to resolve. Understanding whether LLMs’ geospatial knowledge and reasoning can address this gap motivates the study.

Method: Assess LLMs’ geospatial knowledge versus reasoning abilities on tasks tied to compositional geocoding; design an LLM-centric geocoding strategy informed by these insights; fine-tune a smaller LLM and compare it against larger off-the-shelf models.

Result: The proposed strategy improves performance on compositional geocoding. A relatively small fine-tuned LLM achieves performance comparable to much larger off-the-shelf models.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively handle compositional geocoding when guided by an appropriate strategy, and targeted fine-tuning enables smaller models to deliver competitive, cost-efficient performance compared to larger general-purpose LLMs.

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

### [128] [Measuring Moral LLM Responses in Multilingual Capacities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08776)
*Kimaya Basu,Savi Kolari,Allison Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They benchmark multiple frontier and open-source LLMs across low- and high-resource languages on five evaluation dimensions using a 5-point rubric judged by another LLM. GPT-5 scores highest and most consistently; Gemini 2.5 Pro scores lowest in key safety-related categories. Results highlight multilingual inconsistency and call for more cross-lingual safety testing and improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are used globally across many languages, ensuring their accuracy, consistency, and safety across multilingual contexts is critical. Existing datasets enable benchmarking, but systematic evaluation across languages—especially low-resource ones—and across safety/ethics dimensions remains underexplored.

Method: Evaluate several frontier and open-source models across five dimensions in both low- and high-resource languages. Use a five-point grading rubric and an LLM-as-judge to score responses. Compare average scores by category (e.g., Consent & Autonomy, Harm Prevention & Safety) and by language resource level.

Result: GPT-5 performs best on average across all categories. Other models show greater cross-language and cross-category variability. In Consent & Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety, GPT achieves averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro records the lowest averages of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively.

Conclusion: Multilingual robustness and safety vary significantly across models, with frontier models (GPT-5) outperforming others. The findings underscore the need for expanded multilingual testing, deeper analysis of linguistic shifts on model behavior, and targeted improvements to safety and autonomy-related behaviors across languages.

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories
and improvement in these areas.

*S M Rafiuddin,Muntaha Nujat Khan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive Retention learns to keep only the most useful token representations in Transformers under a global budget, retaining 30–50% of tokens while maintaining ≥95% task performance and cutting memory/latency substantially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention scales as O(n^2), making long-context processing memory- and compute-heavy; the goal is to reduce cost without degrading accuracy or altering core attention/task heads.

Method: Introduce a layer-wise, probabilistic token selection mechanism with Bernoulli gates trained via a Hard-Concrete (variational) relaxation. During inference, enforce a strict global budget M using a simple top-M rule to decide which tokens to retain. The approach is differentiable and drop-in for standard encoders, architecture-agnostic, and does not modify base attention or task heads.

Result: On classification, extractive QA, and long-document summarization, retaining only 30–50% of tokens preserves ≥95% of full-model performance, reduces peak memory by ~35–45%, and improves throughput by up to ~1.8×.

Conclusion: Adaptive Retention offers a practical, architecture-agnostic way to make long-context Transformers more efficient by learning which tokens to keep, achieving strong accuracy–efficiency trade-offs without changing attention or heads.

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

### [130] [Benchmarking Chinese Commonsense Reasoning with a Multi-hop Reasoning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08800)
*Wangjie You,Xusheng Wang,Xing Wang,Wenxiang Jiao,Chao Feng,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce CCMOR, a Chinese commonsense multi-hop reasoning benchmark built via an LLM+human pipeline, and show current LLMs struggle on long-tail, knowledge-intensive Chinese reasoning, while retrieval augmentation markedly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in general Chinese contexts—especially multi-hop reasoning that integrates Chinese-specific factual knowledge—is lacking.

Method: Build a domain-balanced seed set from existing QA data; use an LLM-driven pipeline to create multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains; employ human-in-the-loop expert validation and refinement; evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmark, including with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Result: SOTA LLMs show persistent weaknesses on long-tail knowledge and knowledge-intensive multi-step reasoning tasks; applying RAG significantly boosts accuracy, mitigating knowledge gaps.

Conclusion: CCMOR surfaces critical deficiencies in Chinese multi-hop commonsense reasoning and demonstrates that retrieval grounding is a practical path to improvement; the benchmark can guide future model and evaluation design focused on knowledge integration and reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

### [131] [MOSAIC: Multi-agent Orchestration for Task-Intelligent Scientific Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08804)
*Siddeshwar Raghavan,Tanwi Mallick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a training-free, multi-agent LLM framework that decomposes scientific coding problems into substeps, self-reflects, codes, and debugs within a student–teacher setup, using a Consolidated Context Window to reduce hallucinations; it outperforms prior methods on scientific coding benchmarks in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific code generation differs from general coding: it demands rigor, deep domain knowledge, multi-step reasoning across chained subproblems, and algorithmic iteration without I/O test cases—areas where standard code LLMs struggle.

Method: Design a set of specialized agents (student–teacher paradigm) that perform stepwise problem decomposition, rationale formation, coding, and targeted debugging; integrate a Consolidated Context Window (CCW) to keep relevant context and mitigate hallucinations; no additional model training is required.

Result: On scientific coding benchmarks, the framework achieves higher accuracy, greater robustness, and better interpretability compared to existing approaches (details/metrics not provided in the abstract).

Conclusion: A tailored agentic approach with CCW effectively addresses complex, chained scientific coding tasks, reducing hallucinations and improving performance and explainability over baselines.

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

### [132] [The Model's Language Matters: A Comparative Privacy Analysis of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08813)
*Abhishek K. Mishra,Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language structure materially affects privacy leakage in LLMs: redundancy and tokenization granularity correlate with higher leakage. Among EN/ES/FR/IT medical-domain models, Italian leaks the most; English shows greater membership inference vulnerability; French and Spanish are more resilient, likely due to higher morphological complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are widely used in multilingual, sensitive domains (e.g., medicine), but privacy risks have been studied mostly in English. It is unclear how cross-linguistic properties influence memorization and membership leakage.

Method: Train/evaluate LLMs on medical corpora in English, Spanish, French, and Italian. Quantify six linguistic indicators (including redundancy, morphological complexity, and tokenization granularity). Assess privacy via three attacks: data extraction, counterfactual memorization, and membership inference.

Result: Privacy vulnerability increases with linguistic redundancy and finer tokenization. Italian shows the strongest leakage across attacks; English has higher membership separability (greater membership inference risk); French and Spanish exhibit greater resilience attributed to higher morphological complexity.

Conclusion: Language matters for privacy: cross-linguistic structure modulates leakage. Deployments should adopt language-aware privacy defenses and evaluate privacy risks per language, not just in English.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

### [133] [Search-on-Graph: Iterative Informed Navigation for Large Language Model Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08825)
*Jia Ao Sun,Hao Yu,Fabrizio Gotti,Fengran Mo,Yihong Wu,Yuchen Hui,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Search-on-Graph (SoG) lets an LLM iteratively navigate a knowledge graph via a single, informed Search step (“observe-then-navigate”), avoiding brittle query planning and noisy subgraph retrieval, and achieves state-of-the-art KGQA performance (notably +16% on Wikidata) without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions due to missing long-tail facts, hallucinations, and stale internal knowledge. Existing KGQA approaches either require brittle full-query planning, fetch overly large/noisy subgraphs, or rely on complex multi-agent exploration that explodes the search space. A simpler, robust, schema-adaptive way to leverage KGs is needed.

Method: SoG introduces a single, carefully designed Search function that enables stepwise, informed graph navigation. At each step, the LLM observes the actual outgoing relations from the current entity and then chooses the next hop (“observe-then-navigate”), rather than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs. It adapts to diverse KG schemas and mitigates high-degree node noise via adaptive filtering. No fine-tuning is required.

Result: Across six KGQA benchmarks on Freebase and Wikidata, SoG sets new state-of-the-art results, with particularly strong gains on Wikidata (approximately +16% over prior best) and consistent improvements on Freebase.

Conclusion: Iterative, relation-aware navigation driven by a single Search interface provides a robust, adaptable, and simple way to fuse LLM reasoning with KG evidence, reducing brittleness and noise and delivering SOTA KGQA performance without model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

### [134] [Pattern Enhanced Multi-Turn Jailbreaking: Exploiting Structural Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08859)
*Ragib Amin Nihal,Rui Wen,Kazuhiro Nakadai,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce PE-CoA, a set of five conversational patterns to craft natural multi-turn jailbreaks, and show it achieves state-of-the-art attack success across 12 LLMs and 10 harm categories, revealing pattern-specific weaknesses and family-level failure modes and arguing for pattern-aware defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn jailbreaks can incrementally bypass safety, but current methods are ad hoc and don’t clarify how conversation styles relate to vulnerabilities across harm categories. There’s a need for a systematic framework to probe LLM safety weak points and to map pattern–vulnerability relationships.

Method: Propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA): five structured conversation patterns for constructing multi-turn jailbreaks via natural dialogue. Evaluate across 12 LLMs and 10 harm categories (e.g., malware, harassment, fraud), comparing against prior jailbreak approaches and analyzing per-pattern robustness and cross-pattern generalization. Release code for reproducibility.

Result: PE-CoA achieves state-of-the-art jailbreak success. Models show distinct, pattern-specific weakness profiles; robustness to one conversational pattern does not transfer to others. Model families tend to share similar failure modes.

Conclusion: LLM safety training has gaps that are exposed by specific conversational patterns; defenses should be pattern-aware rather than monolithic. The framework provides a more systematic way to uncover and study multi-turn vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

### [135] [Quality Estimation Reranking for Document-Level Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08870)
*Krzysztof Mrozinski,Minji Kang,Ahmed Khota,Vincent Michael Sutanto,Giovanni Gatti De Giacomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Document-level QE reranking boosts MT quality by selecting the best translation from candidate pools; learned (SLIDE) and LLM-based (GEMBA-DA) metrics deliver sizable BLEURT-20 gains, with benefits persisting—though reduced—for longer documents and minimal runtime overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While QE reranking is proven at the sentence level, document-level translation is increasingly important yet underexplored; the authors aim to determine whether QE reranking remains effective when scoring full documents rather than sentences.

Method: Evaluate document-level QE reranking across decoder-only LLM MT and encoder-decoder NMT systems using multiple QE metrics: a best learned metric (SLIDE) and a best LLM-based metric (GEMBA-DA). Compare BLEURT-20 improvements as a function of candidate pool size (e.g., 2 vs. 32) and document length (up to 512–1024 source tokens). Assess practical overhead considerations.

Result: With SLIDE, BLEURT-20 improves by +2.00 (2 candidates) and +5.09 (32 candidates); with GEMBA-DA, +1.63 and +4.30 respectively. Gains hold across both decoder-only LLM and encoder-decoder NMT models. For longer documents (512–1024 tokens), 32-candidate reranking still yields +2.34 (SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA), though improvements shrink as inputs lengthen.

Conclusion: Document-level QE reranking is effective and practical, delivering consistent quality gains across MT architectures with modest runtime overhead, and should be considered for document-level MT workflows.

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

### [136] [FinAuditing: A Financial Taxonomy-Structured Multi-Document Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08886)
*Yan Wang,Keyi Wang,Shanshan Yang,Jaisal Patel,Jeff Zhao,Fengran Mo,Xueqing Peng,Lingfei Qian,Jimin Huang,Guojun Xiong,Xiao-Yang Liu,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinAuditing introduces a taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware benchmark built from real US-GAAP XBRL filings to test LLMs on financial auditing across semantic, relational, and numerical consistency. A unified evaluation shows large accuracy drops (60–90%) for 13 LLMs on hierarchical multi-document reasoning, exposing limits of current models and establishing a foundation for more reliable, regulation-aligned financial AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP is complex and XBRL filings are hierarchical and taxonomy-driven, making automated auditing hard. LLMs excel at free text but are unproven on structured, interdependent financial documents. A rigorous benchmark is needed to measure and advance taxonomy-grounded auditing reasoning.

Method: Construct a multi-document benchmark from real US-GAAP XBRL filings with three subtasks: FinSM (semantic consistency), FinRE (relational consistency), and FinMR (numerical consistency). Provide a unified evaluation framework combining retrieval, classification, and reasoning metrics. Evaluate 13 SOTA LLMs in zero-shot settings.

Result: Across subtasks, current LLMs perform inconsistently, with severe accuracy drops (up to 60–90%) when required to reason over hierarchical, multi-document structures. The results highlight systematic weaknesses in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning.

Conclusion: FinAuditing offers a foundation for developing trustworthy, structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. It reveals gaps in current LLM capabilities and supplies an open benchmark (hosted on Hugging Face) to spur progress.

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

### [137] [Exploring Multi-Temperature Strategies for Token- and Rollout-Level Control in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08892)
*Haomin Zhuang,Yujun Zhou,Taicheng Guo,Yue Huang,Fangxu Liu,Kai Song,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They boost LLM reasoning in RL by sampling with different temperatures for different token types: higher for exploratory “reasoning” tokens and lower for factual “knowledge” tokens, with various scheduling strategies, yielding better scores on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has improved LLM reasoning, but prior methods mainly inhibit parameter updates to indirectly encourage exploration. They don’t explicitly guide exploration during token generation. Since tokens play distinct roles (high-entropy reasoning vs low-entropy knowledge), tailoring exploration at the token level could improve reasoning while preserving factuality.

Method: Classify tokens into reasoning vs knowledge (via entropy/role signals) and apply multi-temperature sampling during RL: higher temperature for reasoning tokens to explore solution paths; lower temperature for knowledge tokens to keep facts stable. Explore multiple schedules for when/how to switch temperatures and integrate this into RL training and sampling.

Result: Across several reasoning benchmarks, the multi-temperature approach significantly improves LLM reasoning performance compared to standard single-temperature baselines, with analyses of schedule variants. Code is released.

Conclusion: Token-type-aware, multi-temperature sampling is a simple, complementary way to explicitly drive exploration in RL for LLMs, improving reasoning while maintaining factual correctness. This suggests finer-grained control of sampling can be an effective lever alongside existing RL techniques.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based BioNER reframed as text generation with symbolic boundary tagging, bilingual joint fine-tuning, and a contrastive entity selector achieves SOTA on benchmarks and strong zero-shot cross-lingual generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional BioNER struggles with nested entities, ambiguous boundaries, and poor cross-lingual transfer. The goal is a unified approach that accurately handles flat/nested entities with explicit boundaries while generalizing across languages and tasks.

Method: 1) Reformulate NER as sequence-to-text generation; 2) introduce symbolic tagging to explicitly mark entity boundaries and support nested/flat entities; 3) perform bilingual (Chinese–English) joint fine-tuning over multiple datasets for multilingual/multi-task generalization; 4) add a contrastive learning-based entity selector that filters spurious predictions using boundary-sensitive positive/negative samples.

Result: Across four benchmarks and two unseen corpora, the method reports state-of-the-art performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages.

Conclusion: A unified LLM-generation framework with explicit boundary tagging plus contrastive filtering effectively mitigates nested-entity and boundary ambiguity issues and improves cross-lingual robustness; released code supports reproducibility.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

### [139] [Autoencoding-Free Context Compression for LLMs via Contextual Semantic Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08907)
*Xin Liu,RunSong Zhao,PengCheng Huang,XinYu Liu,JunYi Xiao,ChunYang Xiao,Tong Xiao,Shengxiang Gao,Zhengtao Yu,JingBo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAC replaces autoencoding-based context compressors with anchor-token KV aggregation, avoiding reconstruction mismatch and yielding better accuracy, especially under higher compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoencoding-trained compression tokens optimize for reconstruction rather than downstream task performance, causing a semantic mismatch that weakens task-relevant features during compression.

Method: Semantic-Anchor Compression selects anchor tokens directly from the original context and aggregates surrounding information into their key–value (KV) states. It introduces (1) anchor embeddings to identify critical tokens and (2) a bidirectional attention modification so anchors can gather information from the entire context. This design provides compression capability without autoencoding training.

Result: Across multiple compression ratios, SAC consistently outperforms prior context compression methods. On OOD MRQA, it yields a +1 EM improvement at 5× compression over strong baselines, with larger gains at higher compression ratios.

Conclusion: Architecture-level, training-light compression via anchor tokens preserves task-relevant semantics better than autoencoding compressors, improving accuracy under aggressive compression and generalizing OOD. SAC offers a stronger speed–accuracy trade-off for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

### [140] [Artificial Impressions: Evaluating Large Language Model Behavior Through the Lens of Trait Impressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08915)
*Nicholas Deas,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs implicitly encode stereotype-like “impressions” of prompts that are linearly decodable along SCM warmth/competence axes; these impressions are more stable than models’ explicit self-reports and predict hedging behavior, while being sensitive to content, style, and dialectal features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probe whether LLMs form human-like impressions from language, how these latent impressions relate to downstream behavior (e.g., hedging), and which prompt features shape such impressions—motivated by concerns about bias, fairness, and controllability.

Method: Generate prompts labeled via the Stereotype Content Model (warmth, competence). Train linear probes on hidden activations to predict SCM coordinates. Compare probe-decoded impressions to models’ prompted self-reports; correlate decoded impressions with response qualities (hedging frequency/quality). Analyze how content, stylistic, and dialectal manipulations shift decoded impressions.

Result: Models’ explicit reports of impressions are inconsistent, but SCM dimensions are reliably linearly decodable from hidden states. Decoded impressions significantly predict hedging usage/quality. Content, stylistic, and dialectal cues in prompts measurably shift the decoded impressions.

Conclusion: LLMs carry stable, linearly accessible, stereotype-like impressions that influence response behaviors such as hedging. Linear probing offers a diagnostic for these latent biases, and prompt features can modulate them, underscoring implications for fairness, safety, and control.

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

### [141] [SOP-Maze: Evaluating Large Language Models on Complicated Business Standard Operating Procedures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08942)
*Jiaming Wang,Zhe Tang,Yilin Jin,Peng Ding,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SOP-Maze is a new benchmark of 397 tasks from 23 real-world business SOP scenarios, split into wide-option (LRS) and deep-logic (HRS) tasks. State-of-the-art LLMs largely underperform, revealing issues in procedure following, conversational robustness, and arithmetic/time reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks focus on instruction following and decision-making but rarely capture the complexity of real business Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The authors aim to evaluate and stress-test LLMs on realistic, multi-branch, procedure-heavy tasks found in business workflows.

Method: Construct a benchmark from real-world business SOP data, adapting it into 397 tasks across 23 complex scenarios. Categorize tasks into LRS (breadth: many options requiring precise selection) and HRS (depth: multi-branch logical reasoning). Run extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models and analyze failure modes.

Result: Most state-of-the-art LLMs struggle on SOP-Maze. Three primary error types are identified: (i) route blindness—failure to follow procedural steps; (ii) conversational fragility—poor handling of real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors—mistakes in time and arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts.

Conclusion: Complex SOP-oriented tasks expose significant weaknesses in current LLMs. SOP-Maze offers a rigorous, open-source benchmark to probe breadth and depth challenges, guiding future improvements in procedural reasoning, dialogue robustness, and numerical/time reasoning.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three

### [142] [A Human Behavioral Baseline for Collective Governance in Software Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08956)
*Mobina Noori,Mahasweta Chakraborti,Amy X Zhang,Seth Frey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analyzes 710 OSS projects’ version-controlled governance docs, parsing actors/rules/actions/objects and tracking change via entropy, richness, and Jensen–Shannon divergence; finds growth and balancing of roles/actions without major shifts in rule composition, offering a baseline to assess AI’s impact on authority distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how OSS governance evolves in terms of participation and control, and to create a reproducible baseline for evaluating whether emerging AI-mediated workflows centralize or redistribute authority.

Method: Collect paired snapshots of governance documents from 710 projects; parse text into structured elements (actors, rules, actions, objects); aggregate categories; quantify change using entropy (evenness), richness (diversity), and Jensen–Shannon divergence (drift).

Result: Over time, projects add more roles and actions and distribute them more evenly; the overall composition of rules stays stable (limited drift).

Conclusion: OSS governance tends to expand and balance participation categories without altering prescriptive force. The study offers a reproducible measurement framework to evaluate future shifts—especially those introduced by AI tooling—in authority distribution.

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

### [143] [Creation of the Chinese Adaptive Policy Communication Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08986)
*Bolun Sun,Charles Chang,Yuen Yuen Ang,Pingxu Hao,Ruotong Mu,Yuchen Xu,Zhengxin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They release CAPC-CG, a large, open Chinese policy corpus (1949–2023) annotated with a five-color taxonomy of clarity/ambiguity, with high-reliability labels, metadata, a codebook, gold-standard annotations, and LLM baselines to enable policy-communication and multilingual NLP research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy communication in China lacks open, large-scale, reliably annotated corpora capturing clarity vs. ambiguity (per Ang’s adaptive policy communication theory). Such resources are needed for supervised modeling, diachronic analysis, and cross-lingual studies.

Method: Collect national laws, administrative regulations, and ministerial rules from top Chinese authorities; segment documents into paragraphs (3.3M units); apply a two-round labeling framework using expert and trained coders to assign a five-color taxonomy of language categories; compile gold-standard annotations; compute inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss’s kappa); release metadata, codebook, and run LLM baseline classifiers; describe dataset patterns.

Result: A 3.3M-paragraph corpus spanning 1949–2023 with directive labels; high reliability (Fleiss’s kappa K=0.86 on directive labels); public release includes corpus, metadata, annotation codebook, labeling framework, gold-standard set, and baseline LLM classification results plus observed patterns.

Conclusion: CAPC-CG provides a dependable, large-scale foundation for supervised and exploratory work on adaptive policy communication and supports downstream and multilingual NLP tasks; baseline results demonstrate feasibility and invite further methodological advances and substantive analysis.

Abstract: We introduce CAPC-CG, the Chinese Adaptive Policy Communication (Central
Government) Corpus, the first open dataset of Chinese policy directives
annotated with a five-color taxonomy of clear and ambiguous language
categories, building on Ang's theory of adaptive policy communication. Spanning
1949-2023, this corpus includes national laws, administrative regulations, and
ministerial rules issued by China's top authorities. Each document is segmented
into paragraphs, producing a total of 3.3 million units. Alongside the corpus,
we release comprehensive metadata, a two-round labeling framework, and a
gold-standard annotation set developed by expert and trained coders.
Inter-annotator agreement achieves a Fleiss's kappa of K = 0.86 on directive
labels, indicating high reliability for supervised modeling. We provide
baseline classification results with several large language models (LLMs),
together with our annotation codebook, and describe patterns from the dataset.
This release aims to support downstream tasks and multilingual NLP research in
policy communication.

*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA is a modular, multi-agent LLM-driven framework that converts natural-language math into formal representations, integrating theorem provers; it shows promising effectiveness on real definitions and formal-math datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoformalization is key to bridging natural language and formal reasoning, but existing approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability, and reliability. A flexible architecture is needed to keep pace with rapidly evolving LLMs and tools while improving correctness and efficiency.

Method: Design a multi-agent system (MASA) where collaborating LLM-based agents transform natural-language statements into formal representations. The architecture emphasizes modularity and extensibility, allowing easy integration of new agents and tools, and leverages interactions between LLMs and theorem provers. Demonstrations include real-world mathematical definitions and experiments on formal-math datasets.

Result: Use cases and experiments indicate MASA effectively handles autoformalization tasks and benefits from agent collaboration and theorem-prover feedback. The abstract suggests improved efficiency and reliability but does not provide quantitative metrics or detailed benchmarks.

Conclusion: Multi-agent systems combining LLMs with theorem provers can enhance the reliability and throughput of autoformalization. MASA offers a flexible foundation for researchers and practitioners, though rigorous, quantitative evaluation and broader coverage would strengthen the claims.

Abstract: Autoformalization serves a crucial role in connecting natural language and
formal reasoning. This paper presents MASA, a novel framework for building
multi-agent systems for autoformalization driven by Large Language Models
(LLMs). MASA leverages collaborative agents to convert natural language
statements into their formal representations. The architecture of MASA is
designed with a strong emphasis on modularity, flexibility, and extensibility,
allowing seamless integration of new agents and tools to adapt to a
fast-evolving field. We showcase the effectiveness of MASA through use cases on
real-world mathematical definitions and experiments on formal mathematics
datasets. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems powered by
the interaction of LLMs and theorem provers in enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of autoformalization, providing valuable insights and support for
researchers and practitioners in the field.

### [145] [DARO: Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09001)
*Jingyu Zhou,Lu Ma,Hao Liang,Chengyu Shen,Bin Cui,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They analyze RLVR methods for LLM reasoning, show popular GRPO variants reduce to weighted GRPO, and propose DARO—an adaptive, difficulty-aware reweighting scheme that fixes loss-scale imbalance—yielding faster convergence and better math benchmark scores on multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO-based RLVR relies on static or simplistic weights tied to problem difficulty, which don’t adapt as the model improves. This skews training toward some difficulty bands, causing loss-scale imbalance and limiting overall reasoning gains.

Method: 1) Theoretical unification: prove GRPO variants are weighted forms of GRPO; 2) Diagnose loss-scale issue across difficulty groups; 3) Introduce DARO, which dynamically reweights group losses according to the model’s current learning state (difficulty-aware adaptation) to balance training signal across easy/medium/hard samples.

Result: On Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B, DARO beats four strong baselines over six math benchmarks, converges faster, and achieves higher final scores.

Conclusion: Adaptive, difficulty-aware reweighting corrects GRPO’s static-weight limitations, stabilizes optimization across difficulty levels, and improves RLVR training efficiency and final performance. The work provides a unified lens on GRPO variants and a practical improvement via DARO.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

### [146] [Decoupling Safety into Orthogonal Subspace: Cost-Efficient and Performance-Preserving Alignment for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09004)
*Yutao Mou,Xiaoling Zhou,Yuxiao Luo,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoRA-based refusal adapters trained solely on safety data can boost safety while preserving general capabilities, acting as low-cost, plug-and-play safety patches. Theory and experiments suggest safety adjustments live in a largely orthogonal low-rank subspace, minimizing interference with the model’s core skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment often hurts general performance, and tuning the mix of safety vs. general-purpose data is computationally costly with modest returns. The work seeks a method that improves safety without retraining on large mixed datasets or sacrificing capabilities.

Method: Apply LoRA-based refusal-training using only safety-critical data, treating LoRA as an add-on module. Provide theoretical analysis of representation geometry showing safety lies in a low-rank subspace orthogonal to the model’s main transformation space; validate with experiments comparing safety gains and general-task performance.

Result: Models augmented with safety LoRA show improved refusal behavior and safety metrics without degrading general benchmarks. Training is cheaper since it avoids data-mixture searches. Empirical and theoretical evidence indicates the learned safety components occupy a near-orthogonal, low-rank subspace.

Conclusion: LoRA can serve as a cost-efficient, performance-preserving, plug-and-play safety mechanism. Decoupling safety into an orthogonal low-rank subspace allows targeted safety alignment without interfering with core capabilities, reducing alignment cost and complexity.

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

### [147] [LitE-SQL: A Lightweight and Efficient Text-to-SQL Framework with Vector-based Schema Linking and Execution-Guided Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09014)
*Shengmin Piao,Jieun Lee,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitE-SQL is a lightweight Text-to-SQL framework that couples fast schema retrieval with a compact, fine-tuned generator to achieve near-LLM performance using far fewer parameters, improving deployability and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art Text-to-SQL systems often depend on large, proprietary LLMs, creating barriers around cost, latency, controllability, and data privacy. The authors aim to show that strong Text-to-SQL is achievable with smaller, open models suitable for resource- and privacy-constrained environments.

Method: Two-component framework: (i) Schema Retriever that performs efficient schema linking via a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings; (ii) SQL Generator trained in two stages—supervised fine-tuning followed by execution-guided reinforcement learning—to enable self-correction without expensive multi-candidate decoding.

Result: On BIRD, LitE-SQL attains 72.10% execution accuracy; on Spider 1.0, 88.45%. It matches or surpasses LLM-based methods while using roughly 2x–30x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: High-quality Text-to-SQL can be delivered by compact models. LitE-SQL offers a practical, privacy-friendly, and efficient alternative to large proprietary LLMs, making deployment more feasible in constrained settings.

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

### [148] [Automated Refinement of Essay Scoring Rubrics for Language Models via Reflect-and-Revise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09030)
*Keno Harada,Lui Yoshida,Takeshi Kojima,Yusuke Iwasawa,Yutaka Matsuo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Iteratively refining LLM scoring rubrics via self-reflection on rationales and mismatches with human scores substantially boosts AES accuracy (QWK), sometimes surpassing detailed human rubrics on TOEFL11 and ASAP across multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based essay scoring is highly prompt/rubric sensitive, and current rubrics may not align well with human judgments. Leveraging prompt optimization could systematically improve rubric quality and thus scoring alignment.

Method: Use LLMs to iteratively refine their scoring rubrics: the model reviews its own scoring rationales and discrepancies with human scores on sample essays, then updates the rubric. Evaluate on TOEFL11 and ASAP with GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct, comparing simple initial rubrics and detailed human-authored rubrics. Measure performance via Quadratic Weighted Kappa.

Result: Observed QWK gains up to +0.19 on TOEFL11 and +0.47 on ASAP. With even a simple initial rubric, the refined rubric achieves comparable or better QWK than detailed human rubrics across models.

Conclusion: Iterative rubric refinement is an effective strategy for LLM-based AES, improving alignment with human evaluations and potentially reducing reliance on elaborate human-authored rubrics.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

### [149] [Exploring Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer via Transliteration-Based MLM Fine-Tuning for Critically Low-resource Chakma Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09032)
*Adity Khisa,Nusrat Jahan Lia,Tasnim Mahfuz Nafis,Zarif Masud,Tanzir Pial,Shebuti Rayana,Ahmedul Kabir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They build and release a manually validated Bangla‑transliterated Chakma corpus and show that fine‑tuning multilingual/regional encoder LMs on MLM substantially improves performance on Chakma (up to 73.54% token accuracy; perplexity 2.90), underscoring data quality’s role and OCR limits for Indic scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chakma is a low‑resource Indo‑Aryan language with little digitized data and weak support in mainstream NLP tooling. Leveraging Bangla transliteration offers a practical route to exploit multilingual models and transfer learning, bypassing challenges of OCR and limited resources in native Chakma script.

Method: Curate and manually validate a contextually coherent monolingual corpus of Bangla‑transliterated Chakma from literature. Fine‑tune six encoder-based models (mBERT, XLM‑RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, IndicBERT) on masked language modeling. Evaluate via token accuracy and perplexity; analyze effects of corpus quality and OCR pipelines.

Result: Fine‑tuned multilingual models outperform their off‑the‑shelf counterparts on Bangla‑transliterated Chakma. Best results reach ~73.54% token accuracy and ~2.90 perplexity. Analyses show strong sensitivity to data quality and reveal OCR pipeline shortcomings for morphologically rich Indic scripts.

Conclusion: Bangla transliteration is an effective bridge for transfer learning to Chakma. The released, manually validated corpus enables further multilingual modeling work for this low‑resource language, while highlighting the need for high‑quality data and careful handling of OCR for Indic scripts.

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

### [150] [Large Language Models Do NOT Really Know What They Don't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09033)
*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs’ internal states reflect patterns of knowledge recall rather than truth, making some hallucinations indistinguishable from correct answers when they rely on stored subject knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work hints that LLMs encode ‘factuality’ cues internally, suggesting they might ‘know what they don’t know.’ Yet the same training that yields correct answers also produces shortcut-driven errors. The paper asks whether internal computations can reliably separate true from hallucinated outputs.

Method: Mechanistic analysis of LLM processing on factual queries by contrasting two hallucination types: (1) subject-associated (leveraging stored subject knowledge) vs. (2) subject-detached (not tied to subject knowledge). The authors compare hidden-state geometries and internal recall dynamics (e.g., attention/hidden states/probabilities) across correct and hallucinated cases.

Result: Subject-associated hallucinations follow the same internal recall process as correct responses and occupy overlapping hidden-state geometries, making them indistinguishable. Subject-detached hallucinations form distinct, clustered representations, which are detectable.

Conclusion: LLMs do not encode truthfulness per se in their internal states—only patterns of knowledge recall. Consequently, LLMs often cannot internally ‘know what they don’t know,’ revealing a fundamental limitation for intrinsic hallucination detection.

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

*Muhammad Ali Shafique,Kanwal Mehreen,Muhammad Arham,Maaz Amjad,Sabur Butt,Hamza Farooq*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct is a multilingual Urdu–English LLM built on Llama-3.1-8B, trained with a modified self-instruct pipeline to generate a high-quality, culturally aligned Urdu-centric synthetic dataset, achieving state-of-the-art Urdu performance versus comparable 7–8B models on a sub-$100 budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for low-resource languages like Urdu suffer from scarce high-quality data, cross-lingual inconsistencies, and safety gaps. Relying on translated corpora is costly and often lacks quality and cultural nuance.

Method: Create a multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct) via a modified self-instruct approach using unique prompts and seeds per task and a global task pool. The data explicitly encodes Urdu-native chain-of-thought reasoning, bilingual translation tasks, cultural relevance, and safety alignment. Fine-tune Llama-3.1-8B to produce Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct.

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on Urdu-specific tasks and surpasses Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget under $100.

Conclusion: A modified self-instruct pipeline can efficiently produce high-performing, culturally aligned LLMs for low-resource languages. Code, models, and datasets are publicly released.

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

### [152] [ReFIne: A Framework for Trustworthy Large Reasoning Models with Reliability, Faithfulness, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09062)
*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne is a training framework that combines supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to make chain-of-thought reasoning more trustworthy by enforcing structured, interpretable traces, explicit evidence disclosure, and calibrated self-assessments; on Qwen3 models (1.7B/4B/8B) for math tasks, it substantially improves interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most long CoT work optimizes for answer accuracy and token efficiency, neglecting whether the reasoning is understandable, faithful to the model’s decision process, and reliable. The authors argue that usable reasoning systems must satisfy these three trustworthiness properties.

Method: Integrate supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to train models to: (i) output structured, tag-based reasoning with high-level planning for interpretability; (ii) explicitly cite decisive information and maintain cross-references for faithfulness; and (iii) provide self-assessments of derivational soundness and confidence in final answers for reliability. Applied to Qwen3 (1.7B/4B/8B).

Result: Across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty, ReFIne models produce clearer, better-structured traces and improve metrics on interpretability (+44.0%), faithfulness (+18.8%), and reliability (+42.4%), with informative confidence estimates.

Conclusion: Trustworthiness should be a first-class objective for reasoning models, not just accuracy. ReFIne demonstrates a practical training recipe that enhances interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

### [153] [FrameEOL: Semantic Frame Induction using Causal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09097)
*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrameEOL leverages causal language models with prompting, in‑context learning, and deep metric learning to produce frame-name label embeddings that are then clustered, achieving state-of-the-art semantic frame induction on English and Japanese FrameNet; with only 5 ICL examples in Japanese, it matches MLM-based fine-tuned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most high-performing semantic frame induction methods rely on masked language models. Despite the strong language understanding of causal LMs (GPT/Llama), they have not been applied to this task. The authors aim to exploit CLMs’ capabilities, especially to benefit low-resource languages lacking rich frame annotations.

Method: Introduce FrameEOL: prompt a CLM to output a single frame-name label for a given situation and use that output to form a frame embedding. Improve embedding quality via in-context learning and deep metric learning, then perform clustering over these embeddings to induce frames.

Result: On English and Japanese FrameNet, the proposed CLM-based approach outperforms existing frame induction methods. For Japanese, using only 5 in-context examples, the CLM-based method achieves performance comparable to an MLM-based model fine-tuned with deep metric learning.

Conclusion: CLMs, guided by prompts and minimal examples, can effectively induce semantic frames, rivaling or surpassing MLM-based approaches. This reduces reliance on extensive fine-tuning and is particularly advantageous for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

Motivation: LLMs trained on static corpora struggle with fast‑changing facts and domain‑specific queries. RAG integrates retrieval to inject up‑to‑date, contextual knowledge. With LLMs rapidly improving, the field must reassess when and how RAG remains necessary and effective.

Method: A comprehensive review: defines RAG’s objectives and core components, analyzes key challenges/weaknesses of current RAG frameworks, and surveys applications where baseline LLMs underperform but RAG substantially helps.

Result: Synthesis of limitations (e.g., retrieval quality, grounding, integration) and delineation of scenarios where RAG is still beneficial despite stronger LLMs. Provides case examples/applications rather than new empirical benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traditional RAG’s relative advantage is shrinking as LLMs scale, but RAG remains important for dynamic and specialized knowledge needs. The paper urges rethinking RAG’s role and outlines directions for next‑generation RAG systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

### [155] [DITING: A Multi-Agent Evaluation Framework for Benchmarking Web Novel Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09116)
*Enze Zhang,Jiaying Wang,Mengxi Xiao,Jifei Liu,Ziyan Kuang,Rui Dong,Youzhong Dong,Sophia Ananiadou,Min Peng,Qianqian Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: They introduce DITING, a genre-specific benchmark and evaluation toolkit for Chinese–English web novel translation, plus a reasoning-based metric (AgentEval) and a meta-eval set (MetricAlign). These resources better capture narrative/cultural fidelity and show Chinese-trained LLMs—especially DeepSeek-V3—lead on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have progressed in MT, but web novels pose unique challenges (narrative voice, idioms, cultural nuances, zero pronouns) that surface-level metrics and general MT benchmarks miss, leaving the true capability of LLMs on this genre unclear.

Method: 1) Build DITING: 18K expert-annotated sentence pairs covering six dimensions—idiom translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency, zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety. 2) Propose AgentEval: a multi-agent, reasoning-driven evaluator simulating expert deliberation to judge translations beyond lexical overlap. 3) Create MetricAlign: 300-pair meta-evaluation dataset with error labels and scalar quality scores for comparing metrics. 4) Benchmark 14 open/closed/commercial models and compute correlations with human judgments.

Result: AgentEval attains the strongest correlation with human judgments among seven automatic metrics. Across models, Chinese-trained LLMs outperform larger foreign counterparts; DeepSeek-V3 yields the most faithful, stylistically coherent translations. The new datasets enable fine-grained assessment of narrative and cultural fidelity.

Conclusion: Genre-aware evaluation is essential for web novel translation. The proposed datasets and AgentEval provide a more faithful, fine-grained assessment paradigm, revealing the advantages of Chinese-trained LLMs and setting a foundation for future research and model improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still

methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models

significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for

evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed
analysis confirms that improvements stem from more effective context
utilization.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a

specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual
LLM research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

### [203] [Hypothesis Hunting with Evolving Networks of Autonomous Scientific Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08619)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They present a socially organized multi‑agent LLM system that conducts large‑scale exploratory “hypothesis hunting” on scientific datasets. Agents self‑organize, peer‑review each other, and collectively surface hypotheses that balance diversity, quality, and novelty; on cancer cohorts they rediscover known biomarkers, extend pathways, and propose new targets, though wet‑lab validation remains required.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal scientific datasets enable open‑ended exploration beyond single predefined questions, but existing approaches lack scalable mechanisms to search vast hypothesis spaces while maintaining quality control. The authors aim to formalize and operationalize a process—hypothesis hunting—that coordinates exploration, evaluation, and cumulative discovery.

Method: They introduce AScience, a conceptual framework modeling discovery as interactions among agent behaviors, collaboration networks, and evaluation norms. They instantiate it as ASCollab: a distributed system of heterogeneous LLM-based research agents that self‑organize into evolving networks, generate findings, and peer‑review each other under shared evaluation standards. Performance is evaluated along a diversity‑quality‑novelty frontier on large cancer datasets.

Result: Socially structured agent networks accumulate expert‑rated findings spanning the diversity‑quality‑novelty frontier. The system rediscovered established biomarkers, extended known biological pathways, and suggested potential therapeutic targets in cancer cohorts.

Conclusion: Socially organized, heterogeneous LLM agent networks can sustain scalable exploratory hypothesis generation, yielding cumulatively useful and sometimes novel findings, but they are not substitutes for empirical validation; wet‑lab experiments remain essential.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes using large language models as a policy-aware auditor to critique VRP-generated last‑mile delivery routes; on 400 cases, open-source LLMs flagged routing issues with ~79% accuracy and proprietary reasoning models up to ~86%, suggesting a scalable evaluation layer beyond distance/time metrics for emerging-market logistics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VRP solvers underperform in India due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and distance-estimation constraints; operators need a scalable, policy-driven way to evaluate and prioritize delivery plans beyond purely geometric metrics.

Method: Introduce a framework where LLMs assess VRP routes against policy-based criteria to detect routing issues. Construct a 400-case corpus that is generated, annotated, and evaluated using LLMs; compare open-source vs proprietary reasoning models on their ability to identify issues in routes.

Result: Open-source LLMs achieved ~79% accuracy in identifying routing issues, while proprietary reasoning models reached up to ~86%, indicating that LLM-based critiques can effectively surface policy violations or inefficiencies beyond classical cost metrics.

Conclusion: LLM-based, policy-aware evaluation can complement VRP planning, enabling operators to prioritize higher-quality routes and potentially improve cost efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, particularly in developing regions like India.

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniWM is a unified, memory-augmented world model that jointly imagines future visual states and plans actions in one multimodal autoregressive backbone, yielding tighter prediction–control alignment and strong navigation gains (up to +30% success), lower trajectory error, and zero-shot transfer to TartanDrive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modular pipelines decouple visual world modeling from planning, causing state–action misalignment and poor adaptability in novel or dynamic environments. A unified, imagination-driven approach is needed to robustly ground decisions in predicted visual outcomes.

Method: Introduce UniWM: a single multimodal autoregressive backbone that integrates egocentric visual foresight with action planning. Actions are explicitly conditioned on imagined future observations. A hierarchical memory fuses short-term perceptual details with longer-term trajectory context to enable coherent long-horizon reasoning.

Result: Across Go Stanford, ReCon, SCAND, and HuRoN, UniWM increases navigation success rates by up to 30% and significantly reduces trajectory errors versus strong baselines; it also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to the unseen TartanDrive dataset.

Conclusion: Unifying foresight and planning with hierarchical memory provides a principled path to robust, generalizable embodied navigation by aligning prediction and control and supporting stable long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Augment LLM-based heuristic design with failure-aware feedback and input-space specialization to yield more robust algorithms, achieving ~28× better worst-case performance than FunSearch, improved averages, and unchanged runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-generated heuristics can be brittle: they often underperform on edge cases and lack mechanisms to diagnose and correct failures. The goal is to make automatically designed heuristics robust across the input distribution, particularly improving worst-case behavior, without increasing runtime.

Method: Introduce a failure-driven design loop that (1) exposes the LLM to instances where current heuristics underperform, (2) provides explanations of why those failures occur, and (3) specializes heuristic designs to specific regions of the input space. This combines LLM synthesis with diagnostic feedback and targeted specialization.

Result: Heuristics produced via this approach show approximately 28× better worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, with improved average performance and no runtime penalty.

Conclusion: Simple, failure-aware augmentation of LLM-based heuristic design—using explicit exposure to failures, causal explanations, and input-space specialization—can substantially enhance robustness and overall performance without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS is a lightweight hierarchical multi-agent framework that separates reasoning, strategic oversight, and context organization to curb error compounding in long-horizon LLM tasks, yielding up to 20% accuracy gains on GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity’s Last Exam, with test-time scaling to match DeepResearch and a cost-saving post-training delegation scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, tool-using LLM agents accumulate small errors, hallucinate, and lose coherence, primarily due to poor context management: extended histories obscure key evidence and hinder effective replanning and reflection.

Method: Introduce COMPASS with three specialized components: (1) Main Agent for reasoning and tool use, (2) Meta-Thinker for monitoring progress and issuing strategic interventions, and (3) Context Manager that curates concise, stage-relevant progress briefs. Add a test-time scaling extension for stronger performance and a post-training pipeline that offloads context management to smaller models for efficiency.

Result: On GAIA, BrowseComp, and Humanity’s Last Exam, COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20% over single- and multi-agent baselines. With test-time scaling, performance reaches that of established DeepResearch agents. Delegating context management to smaller models reduces inference cost while maintaining gains.

Conclusion: Explicitly separating and organizing context in a hierarchical agent mitigates long-context pitfalls, improving robustness and effectiveness on complex tasks, while remaining scalable and cost-efficient; results suggest context management is a key lever for advancing long-horizon LLM agents.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [208] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Controlled experiments on literary-style evaluation show both humans and AI exhibit systematic pro‑human attribution bias, with AI amplifying it. Labels ("human" vs "AI") alone can flip evaluative criteria, and the effect generalizes across AI architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI writing proliferates, we need to know how evaluators—human and machine—judge literary style where standards are subjective, and whether authorship labels bias these judgments.

Method: Two studies using Queneau’s Exercises in Style vs GPT‑4 rewrites. Study 1: 556 humans and 13 AI models evaluated passages under blind, correctly labeled, and counterfactually labeled conditions to quantify attribution bias. Study 2: a 14×14 matrix crossing AI evaluators with AI creators to test generalization across models; analysis of how labels alter applied criteria.

Result: Both groups preferred text labeled "human." Humans showed +13.7 percentage point attribution bias (Cohen’s h=0.28, 95% CI: 0.21–0.34). AI models showed a stronger +34.3 pp bias (h=0.70, 95% CI: 0.65–0.76), ~2.5× the human effect (P<0.001). Study 2 found +25.8 pp bias (95% CI: 24.1–27.6%) across architectures. Labels caused evaluators to invert criteria, rating identical features oppositely based solely on perceived authorship.

Conclusion: AI evaluators not only replicate but amplify human cultural bias against AI-labeled creative work, likely learned during training. Authorship labels can systematically distort aesthetic judgment. This is the first controlled human-vs-AI comparison of attribution bias in literary evaluation, with implications for labeling policies, model training, and evaluation protocols.

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

### [209] [What Is Your Agent's GPA? A Framework for Evaluating Agent Goal-Plan-Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08847)
*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agent GPA is an evaluation framework aligned with an agent’s Goal-Plan-Action loop, defining five metrics (Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, Plan Adherence) and demonstrating broad error coverage, high agreement with human judgments, and precise error localization on TRAIL/GAIA and a production dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent evaluations often miss diverse failure modes and offer limited, non-actionable feedback. The authors aim to provide a systematic, operationally grounded way to assess agents and pinpoint where the goal–plan–action pipeline breaks, facilitating targeted improvements.

Method: Formalize the GPA framework mapped to the agent loop. Define five metrics: (1) Goal Fulfillment (do outcomes match goals?), (2) Logical Consistency (are actions consistent with prior actions?), (3) Execution Efficiency (is the path to the goal efficient?), (4) Plan Quality (are plans aligned with goals?), and (5) Plan Adherence (do actions follow the plan?). Implement LLM-based judges to score these metrics and evaluate on TRAIL/GAIA and an internal production-grade data agent dataset, comparing with human annotations.

Result: GPA systematically captures a broad range of agent failures, including all errors on TRAIL/GAIA. LLM judges achieve strong agreement with humans (≈80% to >95% coverage of errors) and localize errors with 86% agreement, enabling targeted remediation.

Conclusion: GPA offers a comprehensive, actionable evaluation paradigm for agents that aligns with their operational loop, supports reliable LLM-based judgment, and effectively localizes errors to guide performance improvements across datasets.

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

### [210] [ReviewerToo: Should AI Join The Program Committee? A Look At The Future of Peer Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08867)
*Gaurav Sahu,Hugo Larochelle,Laurent Charlin,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo is a modular framework for AI-assisted peer review that complements human judgment, achieves near-human accuracy on accept/reject decisions, produces above-average review quality per an LLM judge, and offers integration guidelines for hybrid, scalable peer-review pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Peer review faces inconsistency, subjectivity, and scaling problems as scientific publishing grows. The authors aim to provide a systematic, consistent, and scalable approach by leveraging AI to assist—rather than replace—human reviewers.

Method: They build ReviewerToo, enabling controlled experiments with specialized AI reviewer personas and structured criteria, and allowing partial/complete integration into real conference workflows. Validation uses 1,963 ICLR 2025 submissions. Experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model measure accept/reject classification accuracy and review quality via an LLM judge, alongside an analysis of where AI performs well or poorly.

Result: On accept/reject classification, gpt-oss-120b achieves 81.8% accuracy vs. 83.9% for the average human reviewer. AI-generated reviews are rated higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge but below top experts. The analysis indicates AI strengths in fact-checking and literature coverage, and weaknesses in assessing methodological novelty and theoretical contributions. The authors derive guidelines for workflow integration to enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness.

Conclusion: AI can effectively augment, not replace, human peer review. A hybrid system using ReviewerToo can improve consistency and scalability while reserving complex evaluative judgments for domain experts, laying groundwork for systematic, scalable peer-review in growing scientific ecosystems.

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

### [211] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GTAlign frames user–LLM interaction as a cooperative game and trains/reasons to maximize mutual welfare, yielding more concise, useful answers with lower cost than standard alignment approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often optimize proxy rewards that don’t reflect user welfare, leading to behaviors like unnecessary verbosity or over-clarification. This mismatch resembles a prisoner’s dilemma where individually rational steps (e.g., exhaustive reasoning for safety) reduce collective utility. A principled decision mechanism is needed to align incentives of both the user and the model.

Method: Introduce Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign): during inference, the model constructs payoff matrices inside its reasoning to estimate utilities for user and model, then selects mutually beneficial (cooperative) actions. During training, a mutual-welfare reward encourages responses that improve social efficiency. An additional inference technique adapts responses to changing LLM service pricing using the same game-theoretic reasoning.

Result: Across diverse tasks, GTAlign reportedly improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and measured mutual welfare compared to baselines. It can dynamically adjust behavior under different pricing schemes.

Conclusion: Game-theoretic decision making embedded in both reasoning and training can better align LLM behavior with user and model welfare, achieving more socially efficient outcomes. The approach appears broadly beneficial and adaptable, with released code for reproduction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at
https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GTAlign .

### [212] [LM Fight Arena: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models via Game Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08928)
*Yushuo Zheng,Zicheng Zhang,Xiongkuo Min,Huiyu Duan,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose LM Fight Arena, a dynamic benchmark that pits large multimodal models against each other in Mortal Kombat II to assess real-time visual understanding and sequential tactical decision-making, offering automated, reproducible, and objective evaluation beyond static tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static benchmarks miss how LMMs perform under real-time, adversarial, and interactive conditions that require rapid perception and strategic planning. The authors aim to capture strategic reasoning and adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Build a tournament framework where six leading open- and closed-source LMMs control the same character in Mortal Kombat II. Each agent receives game frames and state data via prompts and outputs the next action. The setup is controlled for fairness and fully automated for reproducibility and objective scoring.

Result: In controlled head-to-head matches, the framework successfully differentiates models’ strategic reasoning and decision-making performance. While the abstract does not list numbers, it reports that the arena provides objective, reproducible comparisons across models.

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena is a challenging, engaging benchmark that bridges AI evaluation and interactive entertainment, enabling systematic, automated assessment of LMMs’ real-time strategic reasoning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

### [213] [RADAR: Mechanistic Pathways for Detecting Data Contamination in LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08931)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Harshwardhan Fartale,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Ishita Prasad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR is a mechanistic-interpretability-based framework that detects data contamination by distinguishing recall from reasoning in LLM outputs, achieving strong accuracy via a 37-feature representation and ensemble classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM benchmarks can be unreliable when models memorize training data, inflating scores without genuine reasoning. A method is needed to detect when responses stem from recall rather than reasoning, improving evaluation integrity.

Method: Proposes RADAR, which computes 37 features capturing both surface-level confidence dynamics and deep internal signals (attention head specialization, circuit dynamics, activation flow). An ensemble of classifiers is trained on these features to classify responses as recall- vs. reasoning-driven.

Result: Overall 93% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set; perfect on unambiguous cases; 76.7% accuracy on difficult, ambiguous examples.

Conclusion: Mechanistic interpretability features can meaningfully separate recall from reasoning, suggesting a path to more reliable LLM evaluation beyond surface metrics.

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

### [214] [FATHOMS-RAG: A Framework for the Assessment of Thinking and Observation in Multimodal Systems that use Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08945)
*Samuel Hildebrand,Curtis Taylor,Sean Oesch,James M Ghawaly Jr,Amir Sadovnik,Ryan Shivers,Brandon Schreiber,Kevin Kurian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose a holistic, multimodal benchmark for RAG pipelines, introduce correctness and hallucination metrics, and show closed-source pipelines outperform open-source ones—especially on multimodal and cross-document tasks—with human raters strongly agreeing with the metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG evaluations often isolate components (e.g., retrieval) and lack coverage of multimodal, cross-document reasoning and hallucination assessment. A comprehensive, end-to-end benchmark is needed to reflect real-world RAG pipeline performance.

Method: Create a 93-question, human-written dataset spanning text, tables, images, and cross-modal/cross-document contexts; define a phrase-level recall metric for answer correctness; build a nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to flag hallucinations; evaluate two open-source retrieval-based pipelines and four closed-source foundation-model pipelines; and validate metric alignment via independent human raters.

Result: Closed-source pipelines significantly outperform open-source ones on both correctness and hallucination metrics, with larger gaps on multimodal and cross-document questions. Human evaluations show strong agreement with the automated metrics (Likert ≈4.62 for correctness, ≈4.53 for hallucination detection).

Conclusion: A holistic, multimodal RAG benchmark with aligned automated metrics is feasible and informative; current open-source pipelines lag behind closed-source systems, particularly on complex multimodal and cross-document reasoning, highlighting areas for improvement in ingestion, retrieval, reasoning, and hallucination mitigation.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

### [215] [EcphoryRAG: Re-Imagining Knowledge-Graph RAG via Human Associative Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08958)
*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG is an entity-centric KG-based RAG system that uses cue entities to trigger multi-hop associative retrieval, dynamically inferring implicit relations; it achieves state-of-the-art multi-hop QA while cutting indexing tokens dramatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-hop question answering needs scalable retrieval that reasons over relations without bloated context windows or exhaustive relation enumeration. Inspired by human memory (cues activating entity engrams), the work seeks a lightweight, cognitively grounded way to retrieve and compose evidence efficiently.

Method: Index only core entities with minimal metadata to form a compact knowledge graph. At query time, extract cue entities, then perform multi-hop associative search over the KG. Dynamically infer implicit relations between entities to populate context for reasoning, avoiding pre-enumeration of all edges.

Result: On 2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, EcphoryRAG sets a new SOTA among KG-RAG systems, raising average EM from 0.392 to 0.474 versus strong baselines like HippoRAG. Indexing cost is reduced by up to 94% tokens compared to other structured RAG approaches.

Conclusion: Entity-cue–driven, multi-hop associative retrieval with lightweight entity indexing and on-the-fly relation inference is an efficient and effective paradigm for complex QA, improving both accuracy and token efficiency over prior KG-RAG methods.

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

### [216] [DualResearch: Entropy-Gated Dual-Graph Retrieval for Answer Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08959)
*Jinxin Shi,Zongsheng Cao,Runmin Ma,Yusong Hu,Jie Zhou,Xin Li,Lei Bai,Liang He,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch is a dual-graph retrieval-and-fusion framework that stabilizes tool-intensive scientific reasoning by combining a breadth semantic graph (background knowledge) and a depth causal graph (execution provenance), converting path evidence to calibrated answer distributions and fusing them with an entropy-gated log-space rule to prioritize certainty and agreement, yielding competitive gains on HLE and GPQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-research systems that orchestrate multiple tools suffer from context pollution, weak evidence grounding, and brittle, hard-to-reproduce execution paths. The authors aim to match the epistemic structure of such reasoning and make it more reliable, transparent, and robust.

Method: Model two complementary graphs: (1) breadth semantic graph encoding stable background knowledge via seed-anchored semantic diffusion with a layer-specific relevance function; (2) depth causal graph capturing execution provenance via causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting. Convert per-layer path evidence into answer distributions, then fuse them in log space with an entropy-gated rule and global calibration to up-weight the more certain channel and amplify agreement. Compress multi-tool execution logs into a concise reasoning graph.

Result: On scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA, the framework achieves competitive performance; when applied to InternAgent logs, accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA. It can stably reconstruct answers from compressed reasoning graphs.

Conclusion: DualResearch complements deep-research systems by providing a principled dual-graph evidence model and calibrated fusion mechanism that improves robustness, evidentiary support, and reproducibility while compressing execution logs into concise, useful reasoning graphs.

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

### [217] [Semantic-Condition Tuning: Fusing Graph Context with Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08966)
*Ruitong Liu,Yan Wen,Te Sun,Yunjia Wu,Pingyang Huang,Zihang Yu,Siyuan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), which extracts a context-aware signal from a knowledge graph with a GNN and uses it to modulate token embeddings before the LLM, yielding better knowledge reasoning than prefix-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prefix-tuning fuses KGs with LLMs by concatenating KG embeddings to text, which ignores rich relational structure and forces the LLM to implicitly align prefixes with inputs, limiting reasoning quality.

Method: SCT has two modules: (1) a Semantic Graph Module that uses a GNN over a local KG neighborhood (with relation-aware guidance) to produce a context-aware semantic condition; (2) a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module that applies two learnable projectors to adaptively modulate textual embeddings feature-wise, creating a pre-fused, knowledge-aware representation fed to the LLM for fine-tuning.

Result: Across standard KG benchmarks, SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines on knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g., KG completion), indicating stronger accuracy and robustness. (No specific numbers provided in the abstract.)

Conclusion: Injecting KG context by modulating input embeddings prior to LLM inference provides a direct, stronger supervision signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning than shallow concatenation-based fusion.

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

*Qixiang Yin,Huanjin Yao,Jianghao Chen,Jiaxing Huang,Zhicheng Zhao,Fei Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V is a 3B-parameter multimodal LLM that boosts reasoning efficiency and accuracy with fewer tokens via a two-stage pipeline: a length-aware RL method (LIPO) for concise, correct reasoning, and a training-free adaptive model-merging scheme (AMM) that unifies specialist models. It achieves faster inference and superior results on 10 multimodal reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often suffer from inefficiency (large size, overthinking) and degraded accuracy when downsized; research on strong reasoning in lightweight MLLMs is limited. The goal is to make small MLLMs both fast and accurate across diverse multimodal tasks while minimizing token usage.

Method: Two-stage optimization: (1) Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that reweights advantages within response groups to favor concise, high-quality answers, reducing unnecessary tokens while maintaining accuracy. (2) Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free merging of multiple task-specialist models by adaptively weighting task vectors and applying a gradient-projection regularization to mitigate conflicts and form a unified model.

Result: Across ten benchmarks spanning math, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general reasoning, Tiny-R1V demonstrates superior accuracy with faster inference and reduced token consumption compared to baselines, despite being a 3B model.

Conclusion: Carefully designed length-aware RL and adaptive, conflict-robust model merging can endow small MLLMs with strong, unified multimodal reasoning, delivering speed and accuracy with fewer tokens and enabling practical deployment of lightweight models.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

*Yincen Qu,Huan Xiao,Feng Li,Hui Zhou,Xiangying Dai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce a unified-reward benchmark and evaluator for travel-planning quality (feasibility, reliability, engagement), release a large dataset, and show RL (GRPO) improves itinerary feasibility and overall reward over prompting/SFT across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with real-world travel planning; existing evaluations miss critical aspects like feasibility, reliability, and user engagement and don’t translate cleanly into optimization for RL.

Method: Build a comprehensive benchmark with fine-grained criteria aggregated into a single reward signal; develop an automatic evaluator calibrated against travel-expert annotations; release a 4,870-query dataset including 219 real-world free-form requests; evaluate diverse approaches—test-time computation, neuro-symbolic pipelines, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning via GRPO—across multiple LLMs.

Result: The evaluator achieves 60.75% agreement with expert judgments and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines; RL methods generally yield more feasible itineraries and higher unified reward scores than prompt-only or SFT baselines across base models.

Conclusion: A unified reward enables standardized comparison and direct RL optimization for travel planning; their evaluator and dataset support research progress, and RL appears particularly effective for improving plan feasibility and overall quality.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They assess LLMs’ ability to grade Olympiad-style proofs and introduce agentic, rubric-generating workflows that improve alignment with human partial-credit grading on curated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With SOTA LLMs now solving most IMO 2025 problems, the bottleneck shifts to evaluating proofs: detecting subtle errors and assigning fair partial credit rather than only binary correctness. Current models can flag errors but are poorly calibrated for partial credit.

Method: Construct two evaluation corpora: (1) 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro solutions graded on a 1–4 scale with detailed error annotations; (2) MathArena IMO/USAMO 2025 solutions graded on a 0–7 scale. Benchmark baseline LLM graders, then propose multi-step agentic workflows that extract/analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics, exploring multiple design choices. Measure agreement with human grades and consistency of partial credit across metrics.

Result: Baseline models reliably identify incorrect (even subtly incorrect) solutions but mis-calibrate partial credit. The agentic, rubric-based workflows achieve higher agreement with human graders and more consistent partial-credit assignment on both the annotated corpus and MathArena datasets.

Conclusion: Structured, rubric-driven agentic grading meaningfully improves LLM proof assessment beyond binary correctness. Releasing code/data supports reproducibility; nevertheless, calibration for partial credit remains a key challenge best addressed via problem-specific, multi-step workflows.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

### [221] [Repairing Regex Vulnerabilities via Localization-Guided Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09037)
*Sicheol Sung,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRR is a hybrid regex-repair framework that localizes the vulnerable subpattern with a deterministic analyzer and then uses an LLM to generate a semantically equivalent fix for that localized segment, yielding a 15.4 percentage-point higher repair rate than prior state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regex-driven systems suffer from ReDoS vulnerabilities. Rule-based repairs are precise but brittle to unseen patterns; LLMs generalize but often break syntax/semantics. A method is needed that preserves reliability while gaining generalization to complex, unseen vulnerabilities.

Method: Decouple detection from repair: (1) a symbolic module deterministically pinpoints the exact vulnerable subpattern, constraining the search space; (2) an LLM proposes a semantically equivalent, safe replacement for only that segment, reducing opportunities for syntactic/semantic errors. This hybrid process aims to combine rule-based precision with LLM flexibility.

Result: The approach repairs complex cases that rule-only systems miss while avoiding LLM-only semantic mistakes, improving the overall repair rate by 15.4 percentage points over the state-of-the-art. Open-source implementation available.

Conclusion: Localized, hybrid LLM+symbolic repair is an effective strategy for ReDoS-prone regexes, balancing generalization and reliability. The paradigm suggests broader applicability to automated program repair where precise localization plus constrained ML generation can outperform either approach alone.

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

### [222] [Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09038)
*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They replace brittle, token-heavy text memories in GUI agents with a compact continuous memory encoded by the VLM, plus a cheap, auto-scaling data flywheel. This preserves fine-grained visual cues, scales with memory size, and boosts success on long-horizon, out-of-distribution GUI tasks to near closed-source SOTA using an open-source 7B VLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI agents need scalable, effective memory to generalize across unfamiliar UIs and long task horizons. Text-based trajectory summaries bloat context windows and omit precise visual details (e.g., widget size/position), and performance degrades with longer prompts.

Method: Encode each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the same VLM (via a Q-Former) and feed them directly into the model’s input layer, reducing context cost while retaining high-fidelity visual information. Scale memory via retrieval with monotonic gains. Build an auto-scaling data flywheel: (i) discover new environments through web search, (ii) synthesize tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) execute rollouts with the agent, and (iv) verify success with the same VLM. Train only the memory encoder using LoRA on a Q-Former (~1.2% params) with ~1,500 samples.

Result: Collected 100k+ trajectories for ~$4,000. The continuous-memory agent shows monotonic improvements with larger memory and retrieval depth and consistently higher success on long-horizon and distribution-shifted benchmarks. Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory reaches performance comparable to closed-source models like GPT-4o and Claude-4.

Conclusion: Continuous, VLM-encoded memory is a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to text memory for GUI agents, enabling robust long-horizon performance and near state-of-the-art results with an open-source backbone. The auto-scaling data flywheel effectively grows training data and facilitates efficient fine-tuning focused on the memory encoder.

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

### [223] [Humanoid Artificial Consciousness Designed with Large Language Model Based on Psychoanalysis and Personality Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09043)
*Sang Hun Kim,Jongmin Lee,Dongkyu Park,So Young Lee,Yosep Chong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They propose an LLM-based “artificial consciousness” framework that blends psychoanalytic constructs (self-awareness, unconscious, preconscious) with 16 MBTI-style personas, evaluates agent decisions across 10 scenarios via surveys, a ChatGPT classifier, and qualitative review, and claims broadly human-like cognition with limited differences between personas and consciousness modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between LLM capabilities and human-like consciousness/cognition, and reduce hallucination-like behavior by incorporating psychological theory to make AI interactions more intuitive and adaptive in complex contexts.

Method: Construct three consciousness modules inspired by psychoanalysis (self-awareness, unconsciousness, preconsciousness). Create 16 agents mapped to MBTI types, each with needs, status, and memories. Design 10 scenarios probing seven attributes (e.g., emotional understanding, logical thinking). Evaluate decision processes and final actions using human surveys, a three-tier ChatGPT-based classification, and qualitative review.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations suggest the system simulates aspects of human-like cognition; however, observed differences between different MBTI personas and among the three consciousness modules were small.

Conclusion: Integrating psychoanalytic structures and personality typologies into agent design may yield more intuitive, adaptable behaviors, potentially improving AI interactions. Yet, limited differentiation among personas/modules tempers the claim and suggests further work is needed to validate and refine the approach.

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

### [224] [MEC$^3$O: Multi-Expert Consensus for Code Time Complexity Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09049)
*Joonghyuk Hahn,Soohan Lim,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MEC^3O is a multi-expert, debate-and-consensus framework that assigns LLMs to specific time-complexity classes, equips them with class-focused prompts, has them debate, and fuses predictions with a weighted consensus, yielding notably better CodeComplex performance than open-source baselines and competitive results vs GPT-4o family models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single LLMs struggle uniformly across all time-complexity classes; different models excel in different regions. This heterogeneity plus issues like Degeneration-of-Thought and majority collapse motivates a class-specialized, debate-driven consensus to improve robustness and accuracy without relying on a separate judge model.

Method: 1) Measure per-class performance of several LLMs; 2) assign each model as an “expert” to the complexity classes where it performs best; 3) craft class-specialized instructions; 4) run structured multi-agent debates among these experts; 5) integrate outputs via a weighted consensus mechanism that reduces reliance on a separate judge and mitigates convergence to incorrect majorities.

Result: On the CodeComplex benchmark, MEC^3O achieves ≥10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 than open-source baselines, surpasses GPT-4o-mini in average macro-F1, and reaches on-par F1 with GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini on average.

Conclusion: Specializing LLMs by complexity class, orchestrating debates, and using weighted consensus effectively improves code time-complexity prediction. The approach reduces Degeneration-of-Thought and judge dependence, and appears competitive with strong closed models; code/data are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

### [225] [OSCAR: Orthogonal Stochastic Control for Alignment-Respecting Diversity in Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09060)
*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training‑free, inference‑time orthogonal perturbations and feature‑space spreading make flow‑based text‑to‑image sampling more diverse without sacrificing fidelity, improving diversity metrics under fixed budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic trajectories in flow‑based T2I models yield limited mode coverage; users must resample repeatedly to find diverse outputs, which is inefficient and costly.

Method: Introduce an inference‑time control that (1) promotes lateral trajectory dispersion via a feature‑space objective and (2) injects time‑scheduled stochastic perturbations projected orthogonally to the generation flow. The orthogonality constraint boosts variation while preserving details and prompt alignment. No retraining or sampler modification is required; compatible with common flow‑matching solvers. Theory shows monotonic increase of a volume surrogate and approximate preservation of the marginal distribution due to the geometric constraint.

Result: Across multiple T2I settings and fixed sampling budgets, the method consistently raises diversity metrics (e.g., Vendi Score, BRISQUE) versus strong baselines, while maintaining image quality and text alignment.

Conclusion: A plug‑and‑play, diversity‑aware sampling procedure for flow‑based T2I that preserves output quality via geometrically constrained noise, offering a principled and practical way to enhance diversity without retraining.

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

### [226] [Physics-Informed High-order Graph Dynamics Identification Learning for Predicting Complex Networks Long-term Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09082)
*Bicheng Wang,Jinping Wang,Yibo Sue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a higher-order, physics-guided framework for long-term prediction of complex network dynamics by combining dynamic hypergraph learning with a Koopman- and physics-informed neural ODE module, achieving accurate and interpretable forecasts on public and industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional graph models capture only pairwise relations and first-order GNNs struggle with non-pairwise (higher-order) interactions. Pure theory-driven models lack accuracy; purely data-driven models lack interpretability. The work aims to bridge this gap for reliable long-horizon predictions in complex networks.

Method: 1) Model higher-order, time-varying relations via dynamic hypergraph learning to capture non-pairwise structure. 2) Use a dual-driven prediction module: (a) Koopman operator theory to lift nonlinear network dynamics into a linear system in latent space; (b) physics-informed neural differential equations to embed physical constraints, improving faithfulness and interpretability.

Result: On public benchmarks and a self-constructed industrial chain network, the approach yields strong accuracy and superior long-term prediction performance compared to baselines (no specific metrics provided).

Conclusion: Higher-order modeling combined with Koopman-based linearization and physics-informed constraints delivers accurate, interpretable, and stable long-term forecasts for complex networks, demonstrating the value of marrying hypergraph dynamics with physics-guided learning.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

*Zhang Zheng,Deheng Ye,Peilin Zhao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model SDG dialogue as a Stackelberg leader–follower game and train LLM agents with RL to craft persuasive utterances, yielding superior performance on three SDGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents in social deduction games have focused on deduction/strategy but underweight persuasion, which is crucial because success depends on shaping others’ beliefs and actions, not only making correct inferences.

Method: Formalize each turn as a Stackelberg competition where the current speaker (leader) anticipates and influences the next player’s (follower) response; develop a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes utterances for persuasive impact based on this leader–follower modeling.

Result: Across three diverse SDGs, agents trained with the proposed framework significantly outperform baseline agents that lack explicit persuasive optimization.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for persuasive communication improves SDG performance, indicating a path toward AI agents capable of strategic social influence with potential applications beyond games.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

### [228] [PAC Reasoning: Controlling the Performance Loss for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09133)
*Hao Zeng,Jianguo Huang,Bingyi Jing,Hongxin Wei,Bo An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce a PAC-guaranteed switching policy that toggles a large reasoning model between “thinking” and “nonthinking” modes using an uncertainty-based upper confidence bound on performance loss, yielding compute savings while provably keeping accuracy degradation within a user-specified tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs are powerful but expensive at inference. Existing dynamic switching methods reduce cost but can add reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees—unacceptable in high-stakes settings. The goal is to reduce compute while guaranteeing a bounded performance loss.

Method: Define an uncertainty score and derive an upper confidence bound (UCB) on the performance loss as a monotone function of this score. Calibrate a threshold so that inputs below it are routed to the nonthinking mode. This thresholding policy provides distribution-free (PAC-style) control of the maximum performance loss relative to the thinking mode under a user-specified tolerance.

Result: Theory shows that the switching rule bounds the performance loss with high probability, independent of the data distribution. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate substantive compute savings while meeting the target loss tolerance, validating both efficiency gains and controlled degradation.

Conclusion: A PAC reasoning framework can safely and efficiently deploy LRMs by routing based on an uncertainty-to-loss UCB, providing distribution-free guarantees on accuracy loss and practical compute reductions, making the approach suitable for reliability-critical applications.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

### [229] [Dr. Bias: Social Disparities in AI-Powered Medical Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09162)
*Emma Kondrup,Anne Imouza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs give different medical advice depending on simulated patient demographics; Indigenous and intersex profiles receive less readable, more complex responses, with disparities worsening for intersectional identities. Authors call for auditing, mitigation, and improved AI literacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs promise accessible, low-cost health guidance and sometimes rival clinicians, but current evaluations ignore the social nature of care and how demographic biases might shape advice quality and exacerbate health disparities.

Method: Exploratory audit: pose a set of medical questions across key clinical domains to LLMs while varying the patient persona (sex, age range, ethnicity). Compare responses using natural-language features (e.g., readability, complexity) across groups, including intersectional combinations.

Result: Responses systematically differ by social group. Indigenous and intersex personas receive advice that is less readable and more complex; disparities are amplified for intersectional identities.

Conclusion: Given growing public trust in LLMs, there is an urgent need for AI literacy and for developers to investigate and mitigate demographic disparities so they do not translate into unjust patient support. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

*Mubaris Nadeem,Madjid Fathi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes knowledge graph–based conceptual models to fuse heterogeneous healthcare knowledge sources, enabling context-aware decision support (with emphasis on rescue operations) by integrating medical knowledge and patient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical decision-making is life-critical and hampered by the complexity, heterogeneity, and fragmentation of medical knowledge and patient information; clinicians need a unified, context-aligned view to support accurate, patient-driven decisions.

Method: Design of multiple conceptual models for knowledge fusion built on a knowledge graph. The paper discusses mechanisms to enable fusion and outlines how diverse, context-specific knowledge sources can be integrated into a unified knowledge graph, targeting rescue/acute-care scenarios.

Result: Provides and evaluates conceptual models and an integration approach showing how multiple contextual knowledge sources can be aligned within a knowledge graph for decision support in rescue operations. No quantitative outcomes are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Knowledge graph–based fusion is a viable way to unify and operationalize heterogeneous medical knowledge for critical decision-making, particularly in rescue operations; integrating multiple aligned sources can enhance clinicians’ ability to select relevant information, though practical implementation and empirical validation remain future steps.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

### [231] [RegexPSPACE: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Reasoning on PSPACE-complete Regex Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09227)
*Hyundong Jin,Joonghyuk Hahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: They introduce RegexPSPACE, a benchmark built from two PSPACE-complete regex tasks—equivalence (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin)—to probe the spatial (context/memory) limits of LLMs/LRMs, and show current models commonly fail, exhibiting verbosity and repetition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior evaluations mostly target NP-class problems; the authors argue PSPACE-complete tasks better stress-test models’ ability to manage large search spaces and spatial complexity constrained by finite context windows.

Method: Construct a >1M-instance labeled dataset via double-exponential space exploration over regular expressions with a sound filtering pipeline; define structured tasks and quantitative metrics for RegexEQ and RegexMin; evaluate 6 LLMs and 5 LRMs across scales and analyze failure modes.

Result: Across models, performance is poor with recurring failure patterns (verbosity and repetition). The benchmark exposes limitations linked to spatial computational constraints rather than mere pattern recall.

Conclusion: RegexPSPACE provides the first empirical, structured testbed for spatial computational limits of LLMs/LRMs on PSPACE-complete problems, highlighting a gap between current reasoning abilities and the requirements of high-space complexity tasks; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

*Victor de Lamo Castrillo,Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of LLM-powered agent architectures, outlining perception–reasoning–memory–execution components and techniques (e.g., CoT, ToT) to enable autonomous, human-like task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLMs struggle with long-horizon, multi-step, and real-world interactive tasks. The paper seeks design patterns to make LLMs more agentic—able to plan, act, adapt to feedback, and close the gap with human performance.

Method: A review/synthesis of prior work, organizing agent systems into four subsystems: perception (state representation), reasoning (planning and self-evaluation with CoT/ToT), memory (short- and long-term knowledge), and execution (tool use/action). It discusses how these modules interact to support autonomy.

Result: Provides a conceptual architecture and taxonomy, highlighting techniques and their roles; argues that integrating these modules yields more capable, generalizable software agents. No new empirical benchmark results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Integrating perception, reasoning, memory, and execution subsystems can produce more autonomous, human-like LLM agents. The paper positions this integration as the pathway to robust, generalized software bots for complex tasks.

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

### [233] [Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a “locality dial” that lets a single LLM continuously trade off interpretability (localist, rule-like behavior) and performance (distributed, generalizable behavior) at both training and inference time, enforced via group-sparse attention, information-theoretic anchors, and dynamic rule injection, with proofs that sufficient sparsity yields concentrated, low-entropy, high-fidelity attention on relevant blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face a tension between interpretability/transparency and generalization/efficiency. Many domains (regulated settings) require models that can be both transparent and capable, ideally without retraining separate models. The work aims to provide a controllable mechanism to move along this trade-off continuum on demand.

Method: Introduce a tunable “locality dial” that controls representation locality. Implement via: (1) group sparsity penalties on attention heads/blocks; (2) information-theoretic anchor design to bias attention toward semantically meaningful blocks; (3) dynamic rule injection to enforce localist behavior when desired. Provide mathematical analysis proving threshold conditions under which attention concentrates on relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity.

Result: Theoretical results show that when group sparsity surpasses explicit thresholds, attention mass provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, yielding low entropy and high pointer fidelity with negligible error. Empirically implied outcome: users can smoothly interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes without retraining.

Conclusion: A single framework enables continuous, on-demand control over the interpretability–performance trade-off, backed by theoretical guarantees on attention concentration and information efficiency, making it suitable for transparency-critical applications while retaining capability.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

### [234] [Toward Mechanistic Explanation of Deductive Reasoning in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09340)
*Davide Maltoni,Matteo Ferrara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shows a small language model can perform deductive reasoning by learning explicit rules, and provides a low-level mechanistic account: induction heads implement rule completion and chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models appear to reason, but how they do so internally—and whether they truly learn rules versus mere statistics—remains unclear. The work aims to open this black box and identify the components responsible for logical inference.

Method: Train/evaluate a small language model on a deductive reasoning task and apply mechanistic interpretability to its internal representations and circuits, focusing on heads implicated in sequential pattern use. Provide a fine-grained analysis linking components to steps of logical inference.

Result: The model solves the deductive task by learning underlying rules rather than behaving purely as a statistical pattern matcher. Induction heads are identified as central to two key operations: rule completion and rule chaining within the inference process. A low-level description of the relevant circuits and representations is provided.

Conclusion: Deductive reasoning in small language models can arise from learned rule-based mechanisms. Induction heads are pivotal for implementing the core steps of logical inference, offering concrete, mechanistic insight into how such models perform reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

### [235] [Sequence Variables: A Constraint Programming Computational Domain for Routing and Sequencing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09373)
*Augustin Delecluse,Pierre Schaus,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces sequence variables as a new CP domain for VRP that natively supports optional visits and insertion-based heuristics/LNS, adds dedicated consistency levels and global constraints, implements them in trail-based solvers, and shows simplified modeling with competitive results on Dial-a-Ride.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical CP successor-variable models struggle with optional visits and are ill-suited to insertion heuristics common in VRP (including insertion-based LNS). A more expressive variable domain is needed to model visit sequences directly while remaining compatible with CP propagation and search.

Method: Formalize sequence variables as a computational domain in CP; define their domain representation, update operations, and multiple consistency levels for constraints on sequences. Describe data structures for integrating them into trail-based CP solvers. Design global constraints tailored to sequence variables and vehicle routing. Use insertion heuristics, including insertion-based LNS, within this framework.

Result: The implementation simplifies VRP/DARP modeling and achieves competitive computational performance. Sequence variables enable effective handling of optional visits and support insertion-based search strategies.

Conclusion: Sequence variables provide a practical, solver-integrated abstraction for CP models of VRP, bridging declarative modeling with insertion-centric heuristics and delivering both modeling clarity and strong performance on benchmark Dial-a-Ride instances.

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

### [236] [Agentic Systems in Radiology: Design, Applications, Evaluation, and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09404)
*Christian Bluethgen,Dave Van Veen,Daniel Truhn,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Michael Moor,Malgorzata Polacin,Akshay Chaudhari,Thomas Frauenfelder,Curtis P. Langlotz,Michael Krauthammer,Farhad Nooralahzadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Review argues radiology is primed for LLM-driven agentic systems that orchestrate multi-step, tool-augmented workflows; it surveys design patterns, applications, evaluation of planning/tool use, and key challenges (error cascades, efficiency, health IT integration).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can perform isolated radiology tasks (e.g., information extraction, report summarization) but fall short for complex, context-dependent workflows spanning multiple systems and modalities; radiology’s multimodal, high-throughput environment needs adaptive automation beyond single-task LLMs.

Method: Narrative/technical review of LLM-driven agents: how to equip LLMs with external tools and feedback loops, architectural choices enabling varying autonomy, representative radiology applications, and evaluation strategies for planning and tool use; it also synthesizes practical integration and safety concerns.

Result: Synthesizes design considerations for agentic LLM systems, highlights promising radiology use cases, and outlines evaluation methods; identifies failure modes like error cascades, inefficiencies in tool calls, and obstacles in integrating with health IT infrastructure.

Conclusion: LLM-based agents, when combined with tools and feedback mechanisms, can meaningfully automate and adapt radiology workflows, but safe and effective deployment hinges on robust evaluation of planning/tool use, efficiency optimizations, guardrails against cascading errors, and seamless integration with clinical IT systems.

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

### [237] [Titans Revisited: A Lightweight Reimplementation and Critical Analysis of a Test-Time Memory Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09551)
*Gavriel Di Nepi,Federico Siciliano,Fabrizio Silvestri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Authors reimplement Google’s Titans (Learning at Test Time) and evaluate it on masked language modeling, time‑series forecasting, and recommendation. Titans doesn’t consistently beat strong baselines—largely due to chunking—but its neural memory reliably improves over attention‑only models, indicating promise alongside practical caveats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Titans showed strong results but lacked public code and had ambiguities, impeding reproducibility and fair assessment. The authors aim to validate and clarify Titans’ real-world performance across diverse tasks.

Method: Develop a lightweight reimplementation of Titans and run comprehensive benchmarks on MLM, time‑series forecasting, and recommendation. Compare against established baselines, isolating the effect of the Neural Memory component and analyzing the impact of chunking versus attention-only architectures.

Result: Titans does not always outperform established baselines, with chunking identified as a key factor limiting performance. However, the Neural Memory module consistently yields improvements relative to attention‑only models across tasks.

Conclusion: Titans’ Neural Memory is a useful innovation that can boost performance, but the overall approach has practical limitations (notably chunking) and unresolved ambiguities. The work underscores the need for clearer design details, public code, and further research to refine memory integration and mitigate chunking drawbacks.

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test
Time, a neural memory model achieving strong empirical results across multiple
tasks. However, the lack of publicly available code and ambiguities in the
original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

### [238] [Safe, Untrusted, "Proof-Carrying" AI Agents: toward the agentic lakehouse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09567)
*Jacopo Tagliabue,Ciro Greco*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an API-first, programmable lakehouse design that enables safe, autonomous (agentic) workflows via data branching, declarative environments, and proof-inspired correctness checks; a prototype shows untrusted AI agents can safely repair production data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven automation in data lakehouses raises trust, correctness, and governance concerns for sensitive workloads. The authors seek abstractions that let agents act autonomously without compromising safety or compliance.

Method: Use Bauplan as a case study to extend lakehouse primitives—data branching and declarative environments—to AI agents. Implement correctness checks inspired by proof-carrying code, and build a proof-of-concept where agents diagnose and repair broken data pipelines under these constraints.

Result: The approach improves reproducibility and observability, reduces the system’s attack surface, and enables agents to repair pipelines safely. The prototype demonstrates that even untrusted agents can operate on production data when constrained by the proposed abstractions and checks.

Conclusion: API-first, programmable lakehouse abstractions can make agentic workflows safe-by-design. With data branching, declarative environments, and correctness-check mechanisms, there is a viable path to fully agentic lakehouses where untrusted AI agents can act safely on production data.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

### [239] [GraphMERT: Efficient and Scalable Distillation of Reliable Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09580)
*Margarita Belova,Jiaxin Xiao,Shikhar Tuli,Niraj K. Jha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT is a small encoder-only model that distills high-quality, provenance-backed, ontology-valid knowledge graphs from domain text, forming a modular neurosymbolic stack with verifiable reasoning. On PubMed diabetes data it dramatically outperforms a much larger LLM at KG factuality and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI promises both abstraction (symbolic) and generalization (neural) but has struggled to scale and to remain interpretable because neural models are implicit and approximate, and automatically building reliable KGs from text is hard. The authors aim to build reliable, scalable, and interpretable domain KGs to enable trustworthy neurosymbolic reasoning.

Method: Introduce GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills KGs from unstructured text and from its own internal representations. The resulting KG, paired with the model, creates a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions plus symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. KGs are constrained to be factual (with provenance) and valid (ontology-consistent). Baseline: a 32B-parameter LLM generating KGs via prompting.

Result: On PubMed diabetes papers, GraphMERT (80M parameters) produces a KG with 69.8% FActScore and 68.8% ValidityScore, while a 32B LLM baseline achieves 40.2% and 43.0%, respectively. Authors also claim state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines.

Conclusion: A compact, efficient neurosymbolic approach (GraphMERT + KG) can scale while improving reliability and interpretability over large LLM-based KG generation. The method yields factual, ontology-consistent KGs with provenance and sets a new performance bar for domain KG construction in neurosymbolic systems.

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

### [240] [LiveOIBench: Can Large Language Models Outperform Human Contestants in Informatics Olympiads?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09595)
*Kaijian Zou,Aaron Xiong,Yunxiang Zhang,Frederick Zhang,Yueqi Ren,Jirong Yang,Ayoung Lee,Shitanshu Bhushan,Lu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench is a new, reproducible, Olympiad-level coding benchmark with 403 expert-curated problems and extensive private tests; it integrates human contestant baselines, supports offline evaluation, plans contamination-free updates, and reveals that even frontier LLMs lag top human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current coding benchmarks lack truly hard problems, have weak/insufficient test coverage, depend on external platform APIs (hurting accessibility and reproducibility), and don’t enable direct comparison to elite human competitors.

Method: Curate 403 problems from 72 official Informatics Olympiads (2023–2025), each with detailed subtasks and ~60 expert-designed test cases; integrate top human contestant scores; design a self-contained offline evaluator; plan periodic updates with newly released Olympiad tasks to avoid training contamination; benchmark 32 LLMs and analyze solution behaviors (analysis vs exploration).

Result: GPT-5 reaches the 81.76th percentile—strong but still below top human contestants (>90th). The best open-weight reasoning model (GPT-OSS-120B) reaches ~60th percentile, indicating a sizable gap to frontier closed models. Behavioral analysis suggests that stronger models emphasize careful problem analysis rather than broad exploratory attempts.

Conclusion: LiveOIBench offers a rigorous, hard, and reproducible benchmark for competitive programming, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons with elite human performance. Current LLMs, including frontier models, still trail top humans; future progress should target structured, precise reasoning while reducing unnecessary exploration. All assets and a public leaderboard will be provided.

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.
