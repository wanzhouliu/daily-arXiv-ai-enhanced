The system is modular in that one first creates a target\nphonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at\neach step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of\nsentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic\nmarkup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications\nof the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic\nfeature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using\nthe phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted\nfrom the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an\northography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or\nCyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the\nlanguage. The system can also translate further sentences into the target\nlanguage.\n  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for\ncreating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in\nexploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any\nparticular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and\nunderstand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly\nwide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different\nlinguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal\nwith more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore\nis the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into\nlow-resource languages.
