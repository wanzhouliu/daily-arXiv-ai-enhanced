Abstract: This paper presents a novel technique for embedding textual data into images using quinary combinations of pixel intensities in RGB space. Existing methods predominantly rely on least and most significant bit (LSB & MSB) manipulation, Pixel Value Differencing (PVD), spatial perturbations in RGB channels, transform domain based methods, Quantization methods, Edge and Region based methods and more recently through deep learning methods and generative AI techniques for hiding textual information in spatial domain of images. Most of them are dependent on pixel intensity flipping over multiple pixels, such as LSB and combination of LSB based methodologies, and on transform coefficients, often resulting in the form of noise. Encoding and Decoding are deterministic in most of the existing approaches and are computationally heavy in case of higher models such as deep learning and gen AI approaches. The proposed method works on quinary pixel intensity combinations in RGB space, where five controlled different pixel intensity variations in each of the R, G, and B channels formulate up to one hundred and twenty five distinct pixel intensity combinations. These combinations are mapped to textual symbols, enabling the representation of uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters, numeric digits, whitespace, and commonly used special characters. Different metrics such as MSE, MAE, SNR, PSNR, SSIM, Histogram Comparison and Heatmap analysis, were evaluated for both original and encoded images resulting in no significant distortion in the images. Furthermore, the method achieves improved embedding efficiency by encoding a complete textual symbol within a single RGB pixel, in contrast to LSB and MSB based approaches that typically require multiple pixels or multi-step processes, as well as transform and learning based methods that incur higher computational overhead.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have shifted towards transformer-based architectures, achieving state-of-the-art video generation but at the cost of quadratic attention complexity, which severely limits scalability for longer sequences. We introduce ReHyAt, a Recurrent Hybrid Attention mechanism that combines the fidelity of softmax attention with the efficiency of linear attention, enabling chunk-wise recurrent reformulation and constant memory usage. Unlike the concurrent linear-only SANA Video, ReHyAt's hybrid design allows efficient distillation from existing softmax-based models, reducing the training cost by two orders of magnitude to ~160 GPU hours, while being competitive in the quality. Our light-weight distillation and finetuning pipeline provides a recipe that can be applied to future state-of-the-art bidirectional softmax-based models. Experiments on VBench and VBench-2.0, as well as a human preference study, demonstrate that ReHyAt achieves state-of-the-art video quality while reducing attention cost from quadratic to linear, unlocking practical scalability for long-duration and on-device video generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting have allowed for real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Nonetheless, these models have significant storage requirements for large and medium-sized scenes, hindering their deployment over cloud and streaming services. Some of the most recent progressive compression techniques for these models rely on progressive masking and scalar quantization techniques to reduce the bitrate of Gaussian attributes using spatial context models. While effective, scalar quantization may not optimally capture the correlations of high-dimensional feature vectors, which can potentially limit the rate-distortion performance.
  In this work, we introduce a novel progressive codec for 3D Gaussian Splatting that replaces traditional methods with a more powerful Residual Vector Quantization approach to compress the primitive features. Our key contribution is an auto-regressive entropy model, guided by a multi-resolution hash grid, that accurately predicts the conditional probability of each successive transmitted index, allowing for coarse and refinement layers to be compressed with high efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains a challenging task: existing metrics often collapse heterogeneous behaviors into single scores and provide little insight into whether errors arise from retrieval,reasoning, or grounding. In this paper, we introduce RAGVUE, a diagnostic and explainable framework for automated, reference-free evaluation of RAG pipelines. RAGVUE decomposes RAG behavior into retrieval quality, answer relevance and completeness, strict claim-level faithfulness, and judge calibration. Each metric includes a structured explanation, making the evaluation process transparent. Our framework supports both manual metric selection and fully automated agentic evaluation. It also provides a Python API, CLI, and a local Streamlit interface for interactive usage. In comparative experiments, RAGVUE surfaces fine-grained failures that existing tools such as RAGAS often overlook. We showcase the full RAGVUE workflow and illustrate how it can be integrated into research pipelines and practical RAG development. The source code and detailed instructions on usage are publicly available on GitHub

Abstract: Human decision-making heavily relies on active sensing, a well-documented cognitive behaviour for evidence gathering to accommodate ever-changing environments. However, its operational mechanism in the real world remains non-trivial. Currently, an in-laboratory paradigm, called evidence accumulation modelling (EAM), points out that human decision-making involves transforming external evidence into internal mental beliefs. However, the gap in evidence affordance between real-world contexts and laboratory settings hinders the effective application of EAM. Here we generalize EAM to the real world and conduct analysis in real-world driving scenarios. A cognitive scheme is proposed to formalize real-world evidence affordance and capture active sensing through eye movements. Empirically, our scheme can plausibly portray the accumulation of drivers' mental beliefs, explaining how active sensing transforms evidence into mental beliefs from the perspective of information utility. Also, our results demonstrate a negative correlation between evidence affordance and attention recruited by individuals, revealing how human drivers adapt their evidence-collection patterns across various contexts. Moreover, we reveal the positive influence of evidence affordance and attention distribution on decision-making propensity. In a nutshell, our computational scheme generalizes EAM to real-world contexts and provides a comprehensive account of how active sensing underlies real-world decision-making, unveiling multifactorial, integrated characteristics in real-world decision-making.

Abstract: The Cyclic Antibandwidth Problem (CABP), a variant of the Antibandwidth Problem, is an NP-hard graph labeling problem with numerous applications. Despite significant research efforts, existing state-of-the-art approaches for CABP are exclusively heuristic or metaheuristic in nature, and exact methods have been limited to restricted graph classes. In this paper, we present the first exact approach for the CABP on general graphs, based on SAT solving, called SAT-CAB. The proposed method is able to systematically explore the solution space and guarantee global optimality, overcoming the limitations of previously reported heuristic algorithms. This approach relies on a novel and efficient SAT encoding of CABP, in which the problem is transformed into a sequence of At-Most-One constraints. In particular, we introduce a compact representation of the At-Most-One constraints inherent to CABP, which significantly reduces the size of the resulting formulas and enables modern SAT solvers to effectively explore the solution space and to certify global optimality. Extensive computational experiments on standard benchmark instances show that the proposed method efficiently solves CABP instances of practical relevance, while identifying several previously unknown optimal solutions. Moreover, global optimal cyclic antibandwidth values are proven for a number of benchmark instances for the first time. Comparative results indicate that SAT-CAB consistently matches or surpasses the best-known solutions obtained by state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms such as MS-GVNS, HABC-CAB, and MACAB, as well as strong commercial Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Programming solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi, particularly on general graphs, while also providing optimality guarantees. These results advance the state of the art for CABP and provide a new baseline for exact and hybrid methods on general graphs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous systems (AS) powered by AI components are increasingly integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and society, raising concerns about their ethical and social impact. To be considered trustworthy, AS must adhere to ethical principles and values. This has led to significant research on the identification and incorporation of ethical requirements in AS system design. A recent development in this area is the introduction of SLEEC (Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural) rules, which provide a comprehensive framework for representing ethical and other normative considerations. This paper proposes a logical representation of SLEEC rules and presents a methodology to embed these ethical requirements using test-score semantics and fuzzy logic. The use of fuzzy logic is motivated by the view of ethics as a domain of possibilities, which allows the resolution of ethical dilemmas that AI systems may encounter. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study.
