This paper introduces the Tear\nFilm Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task\ntear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247\nframes) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',\n'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area\nsegmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and\nefficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini\nbackbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid\nnetwork to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational\nefficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark\nperformance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several\nstate-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design\nTF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages\nmodels trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially\norchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region\nlocalization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully\nautomates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research\nin ocular surface diagnostics.

At LinkedIn, the job person\nfit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job\nrequirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.\nDirectly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to\nyield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and\nthe need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads\nto high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for\nonline use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM\nknowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit\ntasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for\nclassification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better\ndistill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple\ndownstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that\nintegrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the\nknowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training\ntechniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully\nadapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics\nfor both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its\neffectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a\n0.24\\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\\% increase in qualified applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "LANTERN distills a powerful black\u2011box LLM into efficient encoder\u2013decoder student models for job\u2013person fit and explanations, using multi\u2011level (data and logit) distillation plus post\u2011training and prompt engineering, yielding better quality at production latency and measurable engagement gains.", "motivation": "Directly using large or fine\u2011tuned LLMs for job\u2013person fit struggles with domain complexity, structured outputs, and high inference latency\u2014blocking scalable, online deployment that must deliver both fit judgments and detailed, actionable explanations.", "method": "Introduce LANTERN: multi\u2011objective KD from a strong teacher into two students\u2014an encoder for classification (fit score) and a decoder for explanation.

Bengali, being a low-resource language\nwith a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in\ndeveloping such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use\nand focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the\nfirst real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.\nBanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time\nTransport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address\ndialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,\ndeveloped by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional\ndialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the\nRegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of\n24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds.

These models have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the\nrepresentational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer\nfrom shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of\nspeech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute\nimbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,\nand a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately\ntranslating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce\nthe Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text\nmodels more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech\ntokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units\nthat can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability\ntransfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more\ncompute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on\nspeech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and\ncompute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective\nrepresentational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for\nspeech-text models.
