Abstract: Smart farming has emerged as a key technology for advancing modern agriculture through automation and intelligent control. However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection remains challenging due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and temporal instability across frames. Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling.

Abstract: Agriculture supports over 80% of the population in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where infrastructural disruptions limit access to expert crop disease diagnosis. We present an offline-first detection system centered on a newly curated indigenous cactus-fig (Opuntia ficus-indica) dataset consisting of 3,587 field images across three core symptom classes. Given deployment constraints in post-conflict edge environments, we benchmark three mobile-efficient architectures: a custom lightweight CNN, EfficientNet-Lite1, and the CNN-Transformer hybrid MobileViT-XS. While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels. The ARM compatible models are deployed in a Tigrigna and Amharic localized Flutter application supporting fully offline inference on Cortex-A53 class devices, strengthening inclusivity for food security critical diagnostics.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced two fundamentally different paradigms for instance segmentation: specialized models optimized through task-specific fine-tuning and generalist foundation models capable of zero-shot segmentation. This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Realistic signal generation and dataset augmentation are essential for advancing mmWave radar applications such as activity recognition and pose estimation, which rely heavily on diverse, and environment-specific signal datasets. However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches.

Abstract: Pedestrian heat exposure is a critical health risk in dense tropical cities, yet standard routing algorithms often ignore micro-scale thermal variation. Hot Hém is a GeoAI workflow that estimates and operationalizes pedestrian heat exposure in Hô Chí Minh City (HCMC), Vi\d{e}t Nam, colloquially known as Sài Gòn. This spatial data science pipeline combines Google Street View (GSV) imagery, semantic image segmentation, and remote sensing. Two XGBoost models are trained to predict land surface temperature (LST) using a GSV training dataset in selected administrative wards, known as phŏng, and are deployed in a patchwork manner across all OSMnx-derived pedestrian network nodes to enable heat-aware routing. This is a model that, when deployed, can provide a foundation for pinpointing where and further understanding why certain city corridors may experience disproportionately higher temperatures at an infrastructural scale.

Abstract: This paper offers openly available microscopic vehicle trajectory (MVT) datasets collected using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in heterogeneous, area-based urban traffic conditions. Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions. By making these empirical datasets openly available, this work offers researchers a unique opportunity to develop, test, and validate models that more accurately represent complex urban traffic environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/.

Abstract: We introduce CLARGA, a general-purpose multimodal fusion architecture for multimodal representation learning that works with any number and type of modalities without changing the underlying framework. Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks. Overall, CLARGA can be easily plugged into machine learning models for effective and efficient learning of representations across a wide variety of tasks.

Abstract: Subjective well-being is a cornerstone of individual and societal health, yet its scientific measurement has traditionally relied on self-report methods prone to recall bias and high participant burden. This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale.

Abstract: Automated generation of diagnostic pathology reports directly from whole slide images (WSIs) is an emerging direction in computational pathology. Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.

Abstract: Accurate 3D plant models are crucial for computational phenotyping and physics-based simulation; however, current approaches face significant limitations. Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential in autonomous driving, providing vital information about moving objects and obstacles. Detecting objects in distant regions with only a few LiDAR points is still a challenge, and numerous strategies have been developed to address point cloud sparsity through densification.This paper presents a joint completion and detection framework that improves the detection feature in sparse areas while maintaining costs unchanged. Specifically, we propose TransBridge, a novel transformer-based up-sampling block that fuses the features from the detection and completion networks.The detection network can benefit from acquiring implicit completion features derived from the completion network. Additionally, we design the Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to produce dense LiDAR data for the completion network, meeting the requirement for dense point cloud ground truth.Furthermore, we employ the transformer mechanism to establish connections between channels and spatial relations, resulting in a high-resolution feature map used for completion purposes.Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.The results show that our framework consistently improves end-to-end 3D object detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 across multiple methods, indicating its generalization ability. For the two-stage detection framework, it also boosts the mAP up to 5.78 points.

Abstract: Cell painting is a popular technique for creating human-interpretable, high-contrast images of cell morphology. There are two major issues with cell paint: (1) it is labor-intensive and (2) it requires chemical fixation, making the study of cell dynamics impossible. We train a diffusion model (Morphological Observation Neural Enhancement Tool, or MONET) on a large dataset to predict cell paint channels from brightfield images. We show that model quality improves with scale. The model uses a consistency architecture to generate time-lapse videos, despite the impossibility of obtaining cell paint video training data. In addition, we show that this architecture enables a form of in-context learning, allowing the model to partially transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols. Virtual cell painting is not intended to replace physical cell painting completely, but to act as a complementary tool enabling novel workflows in biological research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transforming bi-dimensional sets of image pixels into mono-dimensional sequences with a Peano scan (PS) is an established technique enabling the use of hidden Markov chains (HMCs) for unsupervised image segmentation. Related Bayesian segmentation methods can compete with hidden Markov fields (HMFs)-based ones and are much faster. PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images. Segmentation is performed in an unsupervised manner, with parameters being estimated using the stochastic expectation--maximization (SEM) method. The new HEMC-CPS model presents potential for the modeling and segmentation of more complex images, such as three-dimensional or multi-sensor multi-resolution images. Finally, the HMC-CPS and HEMC-CPS models are not limited to image segmentation and could be used for any kind of spatially correlated data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZS-SAR) is fundamentally constrained by prevailing approaches that rely on aligning skeleton features with static, class-level semantics. This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records. The source code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/DynaPURLS

Abstract: Predictive maintenance is an important sector in modern industries which improves fault detection and cost reduction processes. By using machine learning algorithms in the whole process, the defects detection process can be implemented smoothly. Semiconductor is a sensitive maintenance field that requires predictability in work. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG-19, Xception and Squeeze-Net have demonstrated solid performance in image classification for semiconductor wafer industry, their effectiveness often declines in scenarios with limited and imbalanced data. This study investigates the use of the Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) for classifying wafer map defects under data-constrained conditions. Experimental results reveal that the DeiT model achieves highest classification accuracy of 90.83%, outperforming CNN models such as VGG-19(65%), SqueezeNet(82%), Xception(66%) and Hybrid(67%). DeiT also demonstrated superior F1-score (90.78%) and faster training convergence, with enhanced robustness in detecting minority defect classes. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based models like DeiT in semiconductor wafer defect detection and support predictive maintenance strategies within semiconductor fabrication processes.

Abstract: Accurate capture of human-object interaction from ubiquitous sensors like RGB cameras is important for applications in human understanding, gaming, and robot learning. However, inferring 4D interactions from a single RGB view is highly challenging due to the unknown object and human information, depth ambiguity, occlusion, and complex motion, which hinder consistent 3D and temporal reconstruction. Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error. Our model generalizes beyond the training categories and thus can be applied zero-shot to in-the-wild internet videos. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released.

Abstract: While many vision-language models (VLMs) are developed to answer well-defined, straightforward questions with highly specified targets, as in most benchmarks, they often struggle in practice with complex open-ended tasks, which usually require multiple rounds of exploration and reasoning in the visual space. Such visual thinking paths not only provide step-by-step exploration and verification as an AI detective but also produce better interpretations of the final answers. However, these paths are challenging to evaluate due to the large exploration space of intermediate steps. To bridge the gap, we develop an evaluation suite, ``Visual Reasoning with multi-step EXploration (V-REX)'', which is composed of a benchmark of challenging visual reasoning tasks requiring native multi-step exploration and an evaluation protocol. V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning.

Abstract: The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\% compared to single models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) requires extracting accurate spatial-temporal features with human movements. A mmWave radar point cloud-based HAR system suffers from sparsity and variable-size problems due to the physical features of the mmWave signal. Existing works usually borrow the preprocessing algorithms for the vision-based systems with dense point clouds, which may not be optimal for mmWave radar systems. In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames. We then adopted DDGNN to learn the features residing in the star graph with variable sizes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach outperformed other baseline methods using real-world HAR datasets. Our system achieved an overall classification accuracy of 94.27\%, which gets the near-optimal performance with a vision-based skeleton data accuracy of 97.25\%. We also conducted an inference test on Raspberry Pi~4 to demonstrate its effectiveness on resource-constraint platforms. \sh{ We provided a comprehensive ablation study for variable DDGNN structures to validate our model design. Our system also outperformed three recent radar-specific methods without requiring resampling or frame aggregators.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Federated Learning (FL) for ship detection across diverse satellite datasets, offering a privacy-preserving solution that eliminates the need for data sharing or centralized collection. This approach is particularly advantageous for handling commercial satellite imagery or sensitive ship annotations. Four FL models including FedAvg, FedProx, FedOpt, and FedMedian, are evaluated and compared to a local training baseline, where the YOLOv8 ship detection model is independently trained on each dataset without sharing learned parameters. The results reveal that FL models substantially improve detection accuracy over training on smaller local datasets and achieve performance levels close to global training that uses all datasets during the training. Furthermore, the study underscores the importance of selecting appropriate FL configurations, such as the number of communication rounds and local training epochs, to optimize detection precision while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: After a wildfire, delineating burned areas (BAs) is crucial for quantifying damages and supporting ecosystem recovery. Current BA mapping approaches rely on computer vision models trained on post-event remote sensing imagery, but often overlook their applicability to time-constrained emergency management scenarios. This study introduces a supervised semantic segmentation workflow aimed at boosting both the performance and efficiency of BA delineation. It targets SPOT-6/7 imagery due to its very high resolution and on-demand availability. Experiments are evaluated based on Dice score, Intersection over Union, and inference time. The results show that U-Net and SegFormer models perform similarly with limited training data. However, SegFormer requires more resources, challenging its practical use in emergencies. Incorporating land cover data as an auxiliary task enhances model robustness without increasing inference time. Lastly, Test-Time Augmentation improves BA delineation performance but raises inference time, which can be mitigated with optimization methods like Mixed Precision.

Abstract: Modern text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can synthesize visually compelling clips, yet they remain brittle at fine-scale structure: even state-of-the-art generators often produce distorted faces and hands, warped backgrounds, and temporally inconsistent motion. Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.
  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.
  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

Abstract: Autoregressive video models are promising for world modeling via next-frame prediction, but they suffer from exposure bias: a mismatch between training on clean contexts and inference on self-generated frames, causing errors to compound and quality to drift over time. We introduce Backwards Aggregation (BAgger), a self-supervised scheme that constructs corrective trajectories from the model's own rollouts, teaching it to recover from its mistakes. Unlike prior approaches that rely on few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses, which can hurt quality and diversity, BAgger trains with standard score or flow matching objectives, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time. We instantiate BAgger on causal diffusion transformers and evaluate on text-to-video, video extension, and multi-prompt generation, observing more stable long-horizon motion and better visual consistency with reduced drift.

Abstract: The superior representation capability of pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) has been harnessed for enhancing latent diffusion models (LDMs). These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive ability to jointly reason over visual and textual inputs. However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: The advent of high-quality video generation models has amplified the need for robust watermarking schemes that can be used to reliably detect and track the provenance of generated videos. Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on fully automated pollen recognition across both conventional optical and digital in-line holographic microscopy (DIHM) images of sample slides. Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%. These results demonstrate that GAN-based augmentation can reduce the performance divide, bringing fully automated DIHM workflows for veterinary imaging a small but important step closer to practice.

Abstract: Echocardiography is the most widely used imaging modality in cardiology, yet its interpretation remains labor-intensive and inherently multimodal, requiring view recognition, quantitative measurements, qualitative assessments, and guideline-based reasoning. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved broad success in natural images and certain medical domains, their potential in echocardiography has been limited by the lack of large-scale, clinically grounded image-text datasets and the absence of measurement-based reasoning central to echo interpretation. We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels. Building on this resource, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model that incorporates two novel pretraining objectives: (i) a view-informed contrastive loss that encodes the view-dependent structure of echocardiographic imaging, and (ii) a negation-aware contrastive loss that distinguishes clinically critical negative from positive findings. Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification). We demonstrate that clinically grounded multimodal pretraining yields transferable visual representations and establish EchoVLM as a foundation model for end-to-end echocardiography interpretation. We will release EchoGround-MIMIC and the data curation code, enabling reproducibility and further research in multimodal echocardiography interpretation.

Abstract: The development of machine learning (ML) models based on computed tomography (CT) imaging modality has been a major focus of recent research in the medical imaging domain. Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets. Finally, we provide a convenient python package, Patch-TDA, to facilitate the utilization of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper presents the largest known benchmark dataset for road damage assessment and road alignment, and provides 18 baseline models trained on the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset's post-disaster small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery from 10 federally declared disasters, addressing three challenges within prior post-disaster road damage assessment datasets. While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters.

Abstract: The Greenland ice sheet is melting at an accelerated rate due to processes that are not fully understood and hard to measure. The distribution of surface meltwater can help understand these processes and is observable through remote sensing, but current maps of meltwater face a trade-off: They are either high-resolution in time or space, but not both. We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023. Using SAR-derived meltwater as "ground truth", we show that a deep learning-based method that fuses all data streams is over 10 percentage points more accurate over our study area than existing non deep learning-based approaches that only rely on a regional climate model (83% vs. 95% Acc.) or passive microwave observations (72% vs. 95% Acc.). Alternatively, creating a gridded product through a running window calculation with SAR data underestimates extreme melt events, but also achieves notable accuracy (90%) and does not rely on deep learning. We evaluate standard deep learning methods (UNet and DeepLabv3+), and publish our spatiotemporally aligned dataset as a benchmark, MeltwaterBench, for intercomparisons with more complex data-driven downscaling methods. The code and data are available at $\href{https://github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}{github.com/blutjens/hrmelt}$.

Abstract: Open-world deployment requires models to recognize both known categories and remain reliable when novel classes appear. We present a unified experimental study spanning open-set recognition (OSR) and few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) on CIFAR-10. For OSR, we compare three pretrained frozen visual encoders: ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny and CLIP ViT-B/16,using a linear probe and four post-hoc scoring functions, namely MSP, Energy, Mahalanobis and kNN. Across metrics,such as, AUROC, AUPR, FPR@95, and OSCR, CLIP consistently yields the strongest separability between known and unknown samples, with Energy providing the most stable performance across backbones. For FSCIL, we compare modified SPPR, OrCo, and ConCM using partially frozen ResNet-50 across 1-, 5-, and 10-shot scenarios. ConCM achieves 84.7% accuracy in the 10-shot setting with the cleanest confusion matrix, while all methods show saturation beyond 5 shots. Our controlled evaluation reveals how the backbone architecture and scoring mechanisms affect unknown detection and how prototype-based methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental adaptation.

Abstract: Understanding camera motion is a fundamental problem in embodied perception and 3D scene understanding. While visual methods have advanced rapidly, they often struggle under visually degraded conditions such as motion blur or occlusions. In this work, we show that passive scene sounds provide complementary cues for relative camera pose estimation for in-the-wild videos. We introduce a simple but effective audio-visual framework that integrates direction-ofarrival (DOA) spectra and binauralized embeddings into a state-of-the-art vision-only pose estimation model. Our results on two large datasets show consistent gains over strong visual baselines, plus robustness when the visual information is corrupted. To our knowledge, this represents the first work to successfully leverage audio for relative camera pose estimation in real-world videos, and it establishes incidental, everyday audio as an unexpected but promising signal for a classic spatial challenge.

Abstract: Customized video generation aims to produce videos that faithfully preserve the subject's appearance from reference images while maintaining temporally consistent motion from reference videos. Existing methods struggle to ensure both subject appearance similarity and motion pattern consistency due to the lack of object-level guidance for subject and motion. To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs. Extensive experiments show that SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving its effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation.

Abstract: This study introduces a lightweight perimeter tracking method designed for micro UAV teams operating over wildfire environments under limited bandwidth conditions. Thermal image frames generate coarse hot region masks through adaptive thresholding and morphological refinement, while RGB frames contribute edge cues and suppress texture related false detections using gradient based filtering. A rule level merging strategy selects boundary candidates and simplifies them via the Ramer Douglas Peucker algorithm. The system incorporates periodic beacons and an inertial feedback loop that maintains trajectory stability in the presence of GPS degradation. The guidance loop targets sub 50 ms latency on embedded System on Chip (SoC) platforms by constraining per frame pixel operations and precomputing gradient tables. Small scale simulations demonstrate reductions in average path length and boundary jitter compared to a pure edge tracking baseline, while maintaining environmental coverage measured through intersection merge analysis. Battery consumption and computational utilization confirm the feasibility of achieving 10, 15 m/s forward motion on standard micro platforms. This approach enables rapid deployment in the field, requiring robust sensing and minimal communications for emergency reconnaissance applications.

Abstract: We present a large-scale, longitudinal visual dataset of urban streetlights captured by 22 fixed-angle cameras deployed across Bristol, U.K., from 2021 to 2025. The dataset contains over 526,000 images, collected hourly under diverse lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. Each image is accompanied by rich metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates, and device identifiers. This unique real-world dataset enables detailed investigation of visual drift, anomaly detection, and MLOps strategies in smart city deployments. To promtoe seconardary analysis, we additionally provide a self-supervised framework based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CNN-VAEs). Models are trained separately for each camera node and for day/night image sets. We define two per-sample drift metrics: relative centroid drift, capturing latent space deviation from a baseline quarter, and relative reconstruction error, measuring normalized image-domain degradation.

Abstract: Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Understanding emotional responses in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during social interaction remains a critical challenge in both developmental psychology and human-robot interaction. This study presents a novel deep learning pipeline for emotion recognition in autistic children in response to a name-calling event by a humanoid robot (NAO), under controlled experimental settings. The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks. Emotions were probabilistically labeled using a weighted ensemble of two models: DeepFace's and FER, each contributing to soft-label generation across seven emotion classes. Final classification leveraged a fused embedding optimized via Kullback-Leibler divergence. The proposed method demonstrates robust performance in modeling subtle affective responses and offers significant promise for affective profiling of ASD children in clinical and therapeutic human-robot interaction contexts, as the pipeline effectively captures micro emotional cues in neurodivergent children, addressing a major gap in autism-specific HRI research. This work represents the first such large-scale, real-world dataset and pipeline from India on autism-focused emotion analysis using social robotics, contributing an essential foundation for future personalized assistive technologies.

Abstract: Controllable video synthesis is a central challenge in computer vision, yet current models struggle with fine grained control beyond textual prompts, particularly for cinematic attributes like camera trajectory and genre. Existing datasets often suffer from severe data imbalance, noisy labels, or a significant simulation to real gap. To address this, we introduce CineLOG, a new dataset of 5,000 high quality, balanced, and uncut video clips. Each entry is annotated with a detailed scene description, explicit camera instructions based on a standard cinematic taxonomy, and genre label, ensuring balanced coverage across 17 diverse camera movements and 15 film genres. We also present our novel pipeline designed to create this dataset, which decouples the complex text to video (T2V) generation task into four easier stages with more mature technology. To enable coherent, multi shot sequences, we introduce a novel Trajectory Guided Transition Module that generates smooth spatio-temporal interpolation. Extensive human evaluations show that our pipeline significantly outperforms SOTA end to end T2V models in adhering to specific camera and screenplay instructions, while maintaining professional visual quality. All codes and data are available at https://cine-log.pages.dev.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented vision language models (VLMs) generate explicit chains of thought that promise greater capability and transparency but also introduce new failure modes: models may reach correct answers via visually unfaithful intermediate steps, or reason faithfully yet fail on the final prediction. Standard evaluations that only measure final-answer accuracy cannot distinguish these behaviors. We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training. Across multiple reasoning-trained VLMs and perception-heavy benchmarks, our method reduces Unfaithful Perception Rate while preserving final-answer accuracy, improving the reliability of multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen fine-grained categories demands a model that can distinguish subtle visual differences. This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: We study professional image generation, where a model must synthesize information-dense, scientifically precise illustrations from technical descriptions rather than merely produce visually plausible pictures. To quantify the progress, we introduce ProImage-Bench, a rubric-based benchmark that targets biology schematics, engineering/patent drawings, and general scientific diagrams. For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is essential for quantifying developmental changes in structure and complexity. However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ultra-low bitrate image compression (below 0.05 bits per pixel) is increasingly critical for bandwidth-constrained and computation-limited encoding scenarios such as edge devices. Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting video moments and highlights from natural-language queries have been unified by transformer-based methods. Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous "0" and/or "1" characters, with one character per frame. The "0"/"1" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Empirically, segmentation losses provide a stable complementary learning signal even when the causal LM loss plateaus.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot generalization but remain sensitive to domain shifts at test time. Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) mitigates this issue by adapting prompts with fixed augmentations, which may falter in more challenging settings. In this work, we propose Meta Test-Time Prompt Tuning (MetaTPT), a meta-learning framework that learns a self-supervised auxiliary task to guide test-time prompt tuning. The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views. By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning, MetaTPT improves test-time adaptation under domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly embedded in our daily life, the ability to recognize and adapt to human emotions is essential for effective human-computer interaction. Facial expression recognition (FER) provides a primary channel for inferring affective states, but the dynamic and culturally nuanced nature of emotions requires models that can learn continuously without forgetting prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions. Experiments demonstrate improved accuracy, stronger knowledge retention, and reduced forgetting. This framework contributes to the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems with applications in education, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

Abstract: Designing high-performance object detection architectures is a complex task, where traditional manual design is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is computationally prohibitive. While recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often function as iterative optimizers within a search loop, rather than generating architectures directly from a holistic understanding of the data. To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data "first principles" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components.

Abstract: The evaluation of drag based image editing models is unreliable due to a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This ambiguity stems from inconsistent evaluation protocols and, critically, the absence of datasets containing ground truth target images, making objective comparisons between competing methods difficult. To address this, we introduce \textbf{RealDrag}, the first comprehensive benchmark for point based image editing that includes paired ground truth target images. Our dataset contains over 400 human annotated samples from diverse video sources, providing source/target images, handle/target points, editable region masks, and descriptive captions for both the image and the editing action.
  We also propose four novel, task specific metrics: Semantical Distance (SeD), Outer Mask Preserving Score (OMPS), Inner Patch Preserving Score (IPPS), and Directional Similarity (DiS). These metrics are designed to quantify pixel level matching fidelity, check preservation of non edited (out of mask) regions, and measure semantic alignment with the desired task. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large scale systematic analysis of the field, evaluating 17 SOTA models. Our results reveal clear trade offs among current approaches and establish a robust, reproducible baseline to guide future research. Our dataset and evaluation toolkit will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Transformer architecture search (TAS) aims to automatically discover efficient vision transformers (ViTs), reducing the need for manual design. Existing TAS methods typically train an over-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) that encompasses all candidate architectures (i.e., subnets). However, all subnets share the same set of weights, which leads to interference that degrades the smaller subnets severely. We have found that well-trained small subnets can serve as a good foundation for training larger ones. Motivated by this, we propose a progressive training framework, dubbed GrowTAS, that begins with training small subnets and incorporate larger ones gradually. This enables reducing the interference and stabilizing a training process. We also introduce GrowTAS+ that fine-tunes a subset of weights only to further enhance the performance of large subnets. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and several transfer learning benchmarks, including CIFAR-10/100, Flowers, CARS, and INAT-19, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over current TAS methods

Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables semantic segmentation models to generalize from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection aims to detect arbitrary classes via text prompts. Methods without cross-modal fusion layers (non-fusion) offer faster inference by treating recognition as a retrieval problem, \ie, matching regions to text queries in a shared embedding space. In this work, we fully explore this retrieval philosophy and demonstrate its unique advantages in efficiency and versatility through a model family named WeDetect: (1) State-of-the-art performance. WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation. (2) Fast backtrack of historical data. WeDetect-Uni is a universal proposal generator based on WeDetect. We freeze the entire detector and only finetune an objectness prompt to retrieve generic object proposals across categories. Importantly, the proposal embeddings are class-specific and enable a new application, object retrieval, supporting retrieval objects in historical data. (3) Integration with LMMs for referring expression comprehension (REC). We further propose WeDetect-Ref, an LMM-based object classifier to handle complex referring expressions, which retrieves target objects from the proposal list extracted by WeDetect-Uni. It discards next-token prediction and classifies objects in a single forward pass. Together, the WeDetect family unifies detection, proposal generation, object retrieval, and REC under a coherent retrieval framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 benchmarks with high inference efficiency.

Abstract: Aligning diffusion model outputs with downstream objectives is essential for improving task-specific performance. Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior. Empirical results demonstrate that UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/maurya-goyal10/UniCoDe

To address these challenges, we release Daylily-Leaf, a paired lesion-level dataset comprising 1,746 RGB images and 7,839 lesions captured under both ideal and in-field conditions, and propose TCLeaf-Net, a transformer-convolution hybrid detector optimized for real-field use. TCLeaf-Net is designed to tackle three major challenges. To mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, the transformer-convolution module (TCM) couples global context with locality-preserving convolution to suppress non-leaf regions. To reduce information loss during downsampling, the raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) block combines bilinear resampling and convolution to preserve fine spatial detail. To handle variations in lesion scale and feature shifts, the deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) employs offset-based alignment and multi-receptive-field perception to strengthen multi-scale fusion. Experimental results show that on the in-field split of the Daylily-Leaf dataset, TCLeaf-Net improves mAP@50 by 5.4 percentage points over the baseline model, reaching 78.2\%, while reducing computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory usage by 8.7\%. Moreover, the model outperforms recent YOLO and RT-DETR series in both precision and recall, and demonstrates strong performance on the PlantDoc, Tomato-Leaf, and Rice-Leaf datasets, validating its robustness and generalizability to other plant disease detection scenarios.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding remains challenging due to the extended temporal structure and dense multimodal cues. Despite recent progress, many existing approaches still rely on hand-crafted reasoning pipelines or employ token-consuming video preprocessing to guide MLLMs in autonomous reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VideoARM, an Agentic Reasoning-over-hierarchical-Memory paradigm for long-form video understanding. Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making. Experiments on prevalent benchmarks demonstrate that VideoARM outperforms the state-of-the-art method, DVD, while significantly reducing token consumption for long-form videos.

Abstract: While recent advancements in generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity in video synthesis, creating coherent multi-shot narratives remains a significant challenge. To address this, keyframe-based approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to computationally intensive end-to-end methods, offering the advantages of fine-grained control and greater efficiency. However, these methods often fail to maintain cross-shot consistency and capture cinematic language. In this paper, we introduce STAGE, a SToryboard-Anchored GEneration workflow to reformulate the keyframe-based multi-shot video generation task. Instead of using sparse keyframes, we propose STEP2 to predict a structural storyboard composed of start-end frame pairs for each shot. We introduce the multi-shot memory pack to ensure long-range entity consistency, the dual-encoding strategy for intra-shot coherence, and the two-stage training scheme to learn cinematic inter-shot transition. We also contribute the large-scale ConStoryBoard dataset, including high-quality movie clips with fine-grained annotations for story progression, cinematic attributes, and human preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAGE achieves superior performance in structured narrative control and cross-shot coherence.

Abstract: Video personalization aims to generate videos that faithfully reflect a user-provided subject while following a text prompt. However, existing approaches often rely on heavy video-based finetuning or large-scale video datasets, which impose substantial computational cost and are difficult to scale. Furthermore, they still struggle to maintain fine-grained appearance consistency across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce V-Warper, a training-free coarse-to-fine personalization framework for transformer-based video diffusion models. The framework enhances fine-grained identity fidelity without requiring any additional video training. (1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) A inference-time fine appearance injection stage refines visual fidelity by computing semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query--key features. These correspondences guide the warping of appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions of the generation process, with masking ensuring spatial reliability. V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and it achieves these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning.

Abstract: Human mesh reconstruction (HMR) provides direct insights into body-environment interaction, which enables various immersive applications. While existing large-scale HMR datasets rely heavily on line-of-sight RGB input, vision-based sensing is limited by occlusion, lighting variation, and privacy concerns. To overcome these limitations, recent efforts have explored radio-frequency (RF) mmWave radar for privacy-preserving indoor human sensing. However, current radar datasets are constrained by sparse skeleton labels, limited scale, and simple in-place actions. To advance the HMR research community, we introduce M4Human, the current largest-scale (661K-frame) ($9\times$ prior largest) multimodal benchmark, featuring high-resolution mmWave radar, RGB, and depth data. M4Human provides both raw radar tensors (RT) and processed radar point clouds (RPC) to enable research across different levels of RF signal granularity. M4Human includes high-quality motion capture (MoCap) annotations with 3D meshes and global trajectories, and spans 20 subjects and 50 diverse actions, including in-place, sit-in-place, and free-space sports or rehabilitation movements. We establish benchmarks on both RT and RPC modalities, as well as multimodal fusion with RGB-D modalities. Extensive results highlight the significance of M4Human for radar-based human modeling while revealing persistent challenges under fast, unconstrained motion. The dataset and code will be released after the paper publication.

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved the training efficiency of diffusion transformers. However, these techniques have largely been studied in isolation, leaving unexplored the potential synergies from combining multiple approaches. We present SR-DiT (Speedrun Diffusion Transformer), a framework that systematically integrates token routing, architectural improvements, and training modifications on top of representation alignment. Our approach achieves FID 3.49 and KDD 0.319 on ImageNet-256 using only a 140M parameter model at 400K iterations without classifier-free guidance - comparable to results from 685M parameter models trained significantly longer. To our knowledge, this is a state-of the-art result at this model size. Through extensive ablation studies, we identify which technique combinations are most effective and document both synergies and incompatibilities. We release our framework as a computationally accessible baseline for future research.

Abstract: Generating articulated assets is crucial for robotics, digital twins, and embodied intelligence. Existing generative models often rely on single-view inputs representing closed states, resulting in ambiguous or unrealistic kinematic structures due to the entanglement between geometric shape and joint dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtGen, a conditional diffusion-based framework capable of generating articulated 3D objects with accurate geometry and coherent kinematics from single-view images or text descriptions at arbitrary part-level states. Specifically, ArtGen employs cross-state Monte Carlo sampling to explicitly enforce global kinematic consistency, reducing structural-motion entanglement. Additionally, we integrate a Chain-of-Thought reasoning module to infer robust structural priors, such as part semantics, joint types, and connectivity, guiding a sparse-expert Diffusion Transformer to specialize in diverse kinematic interactions. Furthermore, a compositional 3D-VAE latent prior enhanced with local-global attention effectively captures fine-grained geometry and global part-level relationships. Extensive experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that ArtGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Vertical beam dropout in spinning LiDAR sensors triggered by hardware aging, dust, snow, fog, or bright reflections removes entire vertical slices from the point cloud and severely degrades 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k. These results show that a pure graph attention model operating solely on raw point-cloud geometry can effectively recover dropped vertical beams under realistic sensor degradation.

Abstract: Infographic Visual Question Answering (InfographicVQA) evaluates a model's ability to read and reason over data-rich, layout-heavy visuals that combine text, charts, icons, and design elements. Compared with scene-text or natural-image VQA, infographics require stronger integration of OCR, layout understanding, and numerical and semantic reasoning. We introduce ViInfographicVQA, the first benchmark for Vietnamese InfographicVQA, comprising over 6747 real-world infographics and 20409 human-verified question-answer pairs across economics, healthcare, education, and more. The benchmark includes two evaluation settings. The Single-image task follows the traditional setup in which each question is answered using a single infographic. The Multi-image task requires synthesizing evidence across multiple semantically related infographics and is, to our knowledge, the first Vietnamese evaluation of cross-image reasoning in VQA. We evaluate a range of recent vision-language models on this benchmark, revealing substantial performance disparities, with the most significant errors occurring on Multi-image questions that involve cross-image integration and non-span reasoning. ViInfographicVQA contributes benchmark results for Vietnamese InfographicVQA and sheds light on the limitations of current multimodal models in low-resource contexts, encouraging future exploration of layout-aware and cross-image reasoning methods.

Abstract: Bokeh and monocular depth estimation are tightly coupled through the same lens imaging geometry, yet current methods exploit this connection in incomplete ways. High-quality bokeh rendering pipelines typically depend on noisy depth maps, which amplify estimation errors into visible artifacts, while modern monocular metric depth models still struggle on weakly textured, distant and geometrically ambiguous regions where defocus cues are most informative. We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models.

Abstract: Producing long, coherent video sequences with stable 3D structure remains a major challenge, particularly in streaming scenarios. Motivated by this, we introduce Endless World, a real-time framework for infinite, 3D-consistent video generation.To support infinite video generation, we introduce a conditional autoregressive training strategy that aligns newly generated content with existing video frames. This design preserves long-range dependencies while remaining computationally efficient, enabling real-time inference on a single GPU without additional training overhead.Moreover, our Endless World integrates global 3D-aware attention to provide continuous geometric guidance across time. Our 3D injection mechanism enforces physical plausibility and geometric consistency throughout extended sequences, addressing key challenges in long-horizon and dynamic scene synthesis.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Endless World produces long, stable, and visually coherent videos, achieving competitive or superior performance to existing methods in both visual fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Polyp detectors trained on clean datasets often underperform in real-world endoscopy, where illumination changes, motion blur, and occlusions degrade image quality. Existing approaches struggle with the domain gap between controlled laboratory conditions and clinical practice, where adverse imaging conditions are prevalent. In this work, we propose AdaptiveDetector, a novel two-stage detector-verifier framework comprising a YOLOv11 detector with a vision-language model (VLM) verifier. The detector adaptively adjusts per-frame confidence thresholds under VLM guidance, while the verifier is fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using an asymmetric, cost-sensitive reward function specifically designed to discourage missed detections -- a critical clinical requirement. To enable realistic assessment under challenging conditions, we construct a comprehensive synthetic testbed by systematically degrading clean datasets with adverse conditions commonly encountered in clinical practice, providing a rigorous benchmark for zero-shot evaluation. Extensive zero-shot evaluation on synthetically degraded CVC-ClinicDB and Kvasir-SEG images demonstrates that our approach improves recall by 14 to 22 percentage points over YOLO alone, while precision remains within 0.7 points below to 1.7 points above the baseline. This combination of adaptive thresholding and cost-sensitive reinforcement learning achieves clinically aligned, open-world polyp detection with substantially fewer false negatives, thereby reducing the risk of missed precancerous polyps and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurately modeling light transport is essential for realistic image synthesis. Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently been extended from text-only LLMs to vision-language models (VLMs) to elicit long-chain multimodal reasoning. However, RLVR-trained VLMs still exhibit two persistent failure modes: inaccurate visual extraction (missing or hallucinating details) and logically inconsistent chains-of-thought, largely because verifiable signals supervise only the final answer. We propose PeRL-VL (Perception and Reasoning Learning for Vision-Language Models), a decoupled framework that separately improves visual perception and textual reasoning on top of RLVR. For perception, PeRL-VL introduces a VLM-based description reward that scores the model's self-generated image descriptions for faithfulness and sufficiency. For reasoning, PeRL-VL adds a text-only Reasoning SFT stage on logic-rich chain-of-thought data, enhancing coherence and logical consistency independently of vision. Across diverse multimodal benchmarks, PeRL-VL improves average Pass@1 accuracy from 63.3% (base Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to 68.8%, outperforming standard RLVR, text-only reasoning SFT, and naive multimodal distillation from GPT-4o.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced cross-modal understanding and reasoning by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the semantic space. Building upon this, recent studies extend the CoT mechanism to the visual modality, enabling models to integrate visual information during reasoning through external tools or explicit image generation. However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains difficult under limited supervision and visual domain shift. Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition. It is motivated by the operational need to support triage decisions within the "platinum minutes" and the broader "golden hour" window in time-critical UAV-driven search-and-rescue and combat casualty care.

Abstract: We explore spatiotemporal data augmentation using video foundation models to diversify both camera viewpoints and scene dynamics. Unlike existing approaches based on simple geometric transforms or appearance perturbations, our method leverages off-the-shelf video diffusion models to generate realistic 3D spatial and temporal variations from a given image dataset. Incorporating these synthesized video clips as supplemental training data yields consistent performance gains in low-data settings, such as UAV-captured imagery where annotations are scarce. Beyond empirical improvements, we provide practical guidelines for (i) choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal generative setup, (ii) transferring annotations to synthetic frames, and (iii) addressing disocclusion - regions newly revealed and unlabeled in generated views. Experiments on COCO subsets and UAV-captured datasets show that, when applied judiciously, spatiotemporal augmentation broadens the data distribution along axes underrepresented by traditional and prior generative methods, offering an effective lever for improving model performance in data-scarce regimes.

Abstract: Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines.

Abstract: We present Animus3D, a text-driven 3D animation framework that generates motion field given a static 3D asset and text prompt. Previous methods mostly leverage the vanilla Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) objective to distill motion from pretrained text-to-video diffusion, leading to animations with minimal movement or noticeable jitter. To address this, our approach introduces a novel SDS alternative, Motion Score Distillation (MSD). Specifically, we introduce a LoRA-enhanced video diffusion model that defines a static source distribution rather than pure noise as in SDS, while another inversion-based noise estimation technique ensures appearance preservation when guiding motion. To further improve motion fidelity, we incorporate explicit temporal and spatial regularization terms that mitigate geometric distortions across time and space. Additionally, we propose a motion refinement module to upscale the temporal resolution and enhance fine-grained details, overcoming the fixed-resolution constraints of the underlying video model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Animus3D successfully animates static 3D assets from diverse text prompts, generating significantly more substantial and detailed motion than state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining high visual integrity. Code will be released at https://qiisun.github.io/animus3d_page.

Abstract: Automated road sign recognition is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems, but traditional deep learning methods struggle with the sheer number of sign classes and the impracticality of creating exhaustive labeled datasets. This paper introduces a novel zero-shot recognition framework that adapts the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm to address this challenge. Our method first uses a Vision Language Model (VLM) to generate a textual description of a sign from an input image. This description is used to retrieve a small set of the most relevant sign candidates from a vector database of reference designs. Subsequently, a Large Language Model (LLM) reasons over the retrieved candidates to make a final, fine-grained recognition. We validate this approach on a comprehensive set of 303 regulatory signs from the Ohio MUTCD. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 95.58% accuracy on ideal reference images and 82.45% on challenging real-world road data. This work demonstrates the viability of RAG-based architectures for creating scalable and accurate systems for road sign recognition without task-specific training.

Abstract: Accurate coronary artery segmentation from coronary computed tomography angiography is essential for quantitative coronary analysis and clinical decision support. Nevertheless, reliable segmentation remains challenging because of small vessel calibers, complex branching, blurred boundaries, and myocardial interference. We propose a coronary artery segmentation framework that integrates myocardial anatomical priors, structure aware feature encoding, and three dimensional wavelet inverse wavelet transformations. Myocardial priors and residual attention based feature enhancement are incorporated during encoding to strengthen coronary structure representation. Wavelet inverse wavelet based downsampling and upsampling enable joint spatial frequency modeling and preserve multi scale structural consistency, while a multi scale feature fusion module integrates semantic and geometric information in the decoding stage. The model is trained and evaluated on the public ImageCAS dataset using a 3D overlapping patch based strategy with a 7:1:2 split for training, validation, and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Dice coefficient of 0.8082, Sensitivity of 0.7946, Precision of 0.8471, and an HD95 of 9.77 mm, outperforming several mainstream segmentation models. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of individual components. The proposed method enables more stable and consistent coronary artery segmentation under complex geometric conditions, providing reliable segmentation results for subsequent coronary structure analysis tasks.

Abstract: We propose a supervised contrastive learning framework for video representation learning that leverages temporally global context. We introduce a video to image aggregation strategy that spatially arranges multiple frames from each video into a single input image. This design enables the use of pre trained convolutional neural network backbones such as ResNet50 and avoids the computational overhead of complex video transformer models. We then design a contrastive learning objective that directly compares pairwise projections generated by the model. Positive pairs are defined as projections from videos sharing the same label while all other projections are treated as negatives. Multiple natural views of the same video are created using different temporal frame samplings from the same underlying video. Rather than relying on data augmentation these frame level variations produce diverse positive samples with global context and reduce overfitting. Experiments on the Penn Action and HMDB51 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in classification accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. The proposed Supervised Contrastive Frame Aggregation method learns effective video representations in both supervised and self supervised settings and supports video based tasks such as classification and captioning. The method achieves seventy six percent classification accuracy on Penn Action compared to forty three percent achieved by ViVIT and forty eight percent accuracy on HMDB51 compared to thirty seven percent achieved by ViVIT.

Abstract: This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males.

Abstract: Online video understanding is essential for applications like public surveillance and AI glasses. However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available.

Abstract: To extend the application of vision-language models (VLMs) from web images to sensor-mediated physical environments, we propose Multi-View Physical-prompt for Test-Time Adaptation (MVP), a forward-only framework that moves test-time adaptation (TTA) from tokens to photons by treating the camera exposure triangle--ISO, shutter speed, and aperture--as physical prompts. At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for generating layouts for image-based advertisements by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based "placement plan" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models.

Abstract: This research introduces a transformative framework for integrating Vision-Enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced transformer-based architectures to tackle challenges in high-resolution image synthesis and multimodal data interpretation. The proposed model incorporates a rectified flow mechanism that connects noise and data with linear paths, enabling efficient and high-quality generation. A bidirectional tokenization strategy is employed to seamlessly merge inputs from text, image, and video modalities, fostering a unified understanding across diverse data types. By embedding spatial-temporal features and leveraging a hybrid text-image sequence modeling approach, the framework achieves unparalleled fidelity in synthesized images and coherent multimodal representations. The architecture is optimized with a noise-aware learning algorithm, addressing discrepancies in noisy data distributions and improving generative performance under varying input conditions. Rigorous evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate a 25% increase in image resolution clarity and a 20% reduction in computational requirements compared to diffusion-based methods. Furthermore, the model exhibits robust scalability and adaptability, showcasing its potential in applications like autonomous systems, creative content generation, and advanced video analysis. This work underscores the role of vision-centric LLMs in redefining capabilities in computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have achieved impressive performance on a variety of vision-language tasks, yet their fine-grained visual perception and precise spatial reasoning remain limited. In this work, we introduce DiG (Differential Grounding), a novel proxy task framework where MLLMs learn fine-grained perception by identifying and localizing all differences between similar image pairs without prior knowledge of their number. To support scalable training, we develop an automated 3D rendering-based data generation pipeline that produces high-quality paired images with fully controllable discrepancies. To address the sparsity of difference signals, we further employ curriculum learning that progressively increases complexity from single to multiple differences, enabling stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiG significantly improves model performance across a variety of visual perception benchmarks and that the learned fine-grained perception skills transfer effectively to standard downstream tasks, including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and general multimodal perception benchmarks. Our results highlight differential grounding as a scalable and robust approach for advancing fine-grained visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, ambiguous boundaries between nodules and surrounding tissues, size variations, and the scarcity of annotated ultrasound data pose significant challenges for automated segmentation. Existing deep learning models struggle to incorporate contextual information from the thyroid gland and generalize effectively across diverse cases. To address these challenges, we propose SSMT-Net, a Semi-Supervised Multi-Task Transformer-based Network that leverages unlabeled data to enhance Transformer-centric encoder feature extraction capability in an initial unsupervised phase. In the supervised phase, the model jointly optimizes nodule segmentation, gland segmentation, and nodule size estimation, integrating both local and global contextual features. Extensive evaluations on the TN3K and DDTI datasets demonstrate that SSMT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with higher accuracy and robustness, indicating its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: We study geometry-aware scene-consistent image generation: given a reference scene image and a text condition specifying an entity to be generated in the scene and its spatial relation to the scene, the goal is to synthesize an output image that preserves the same physical environment as the reference scene while correctly generating the entity according to the spatial relation described in the text. Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies. Our method produces geometrically coherent images with diverse compositions that remain faithful to the textual instructions and the underlying scene structure.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation has advanced from single- to multi-subject composition, while neglecting distinction, the ability to identify and generate the correct subject when inputs contain multiple candidates. This limitation restricts effectiveness in complex, realistic visual settings. We propose Scone, a unified understanding-generation method that integrates composition and distinction. Scone enables the understanding expert to act as a semantic bridge, conveying semantic information and guiding the generation expert to preserve subject identity while minimizing interference. A two-stage training scheme first learns composition, then enhances distinction through semantic alignment and attention-based masking. We also introduce SconeEval, a benchmark for evaluating both composition and distinction across diverse scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that Scone outperforms existing open-source models in composition and distinction tasks on two benchmarks. Our model, benchmark, and training data are available at: https://github.com/Ryann-Ran/Scone.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generative quality, but computational overhead scales with step count, model depth, and sequence length. Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods.

Abstract: Instance-level image retrieval aims to find images containing the same object as a given query, despite variations in size, position, or appearance. To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

Abstract: Extracting human motion from large-scale web videos offers a scalable solution to the data scarcity issue in character animation. However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.
  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as "credible". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.
  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a critical dilemma that end-to-end models lack interpretability and explicit 3D reasoning, while modular systems ignore cross-component interdependencies and synergies. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic 3D Vision-Language-Planning Model (D3D-VLP). Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset with 10M hybrid samples from 5K real scans and 20K synthetic scenes that are compatible with online learning methods such as RL and DAgger. Our D3D-VLP achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including Vision-and-Language Navigation (R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE, NavRAG-CE), Object-goal Navigation (HM3D-OVON), and Task-oriented Sequential Grounding and Navigation (SG3D). Real-world mobile manipulation experiments further validate the effectiveness.

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models suggest that explicit reasoning mechanisms play a critical role in improving model reliability, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment. While such reasoning-centric approaches have been proven effective in language and vision tasks, their extension to 3D remains underdeveloped. CoRe3D introduces a unified 3D understanding and generation reasoning framework that jointly operates over semantic and spatial abstractions, enabling high-level intent inferred from language to directly guide low-level 3D content formation. Central to this design is a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in a compositional and procedural manner. By tightly coupling semantic chain-of-thought inference with structured spatial reasoning, CoRe3D produces 3D outputs that exhibit strong local consistency and faithful alignment with linguistic descriptions.

Abstract: Previous work on cross-modal fundus image registration (CMFIR) assumes small cross-modal Field-of-View (FoV) disparity. By contrast, this paper is targeted at a more challenging scenario with large FoV disparity, to which directly applying current methods fails. We propose Crop and Alignment for cross-modal fundus image Registration(CARe), a very simple yet effective method. Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source. This operation allows us to re-purpose the previous small-FoV-disparity oriented methods for subsequent image registration. Moreover, we improve spatial transformation by a double-fitting based Alignment module that utilizes the classical RANSAC algorithm and polynomial-based coordinate fitting in a sequential manner. Extensive experiments on a newly developed test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs verify the viability of CARe for CMFIR.

Abstract: Current document reasoning paradigms are constrained by a fundamental trade-off between scalability (processing long-context documents) and fidelity (capturing fine-grained, multimodal details). To bridge this gap, we propose CogDoc, a unified coarse-to-fine thinking framework that mimics human cognitive processes: a low-resolution "Fast Reading" phase for scalable information localization,followed by a high-resolution "Focused Thinking" phase for deep reasoning. We conduct a rigorous investigation into post-training strategies for the unified thinking framework, demonstrating that a Direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach outperforms RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) initialization. Specifically, we find that direct RL avoids the "policy conflict" observed in SFT. Empirically, our 7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance within its parameter class, notably surpassing significantly larger proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) on challenging, visually rich document benchmarks.

Abstract: Scaling large multimodal models (LMMs) to 3D understanding poses unique challenges: point cloud data is sparse and irregular, existing models rely on fragmented architectures with modality-specific encoders, and training pipelines often suffer from instability and poor scalability. We introduce Lemon, a unified transformer architecture that addresses these challenges by jointly processing 3D point cloud patches and language tokens as a single sequence. Unlike prior work that relies on modality-specific encoders and cross-modal alignment modules, this design enables early spatial-linguistic fusion, eliminates redundant encoders, improves parameter efficiency, and supports more effective model scaling. To handle the complexity of 3D data, we develop a structured patchification and tokenization scheme that preserves spatial context, and a three-stage training curriculum that progressively builds capabilities from object-level recognition to scene-level spatial reasoning. Lemon establishes new state-of-the-art performance across comprehensive 3D understanding and reasoning tasks, from object recognition and captioning to spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, while demonstrating robust scaling properties as model size and training data increase. Our work provides a unified foundation for advancing 3D spatial intelligence in real-world applications.

Abstract: Large-scale multimodal foundation models, particularly Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), have achieved state-of-the-art results by unifying contrastive alignment with generative captioning. While zero-shot transfer capabilities are well-documented, the adaptation of these generative-contrastive hybrids to downstream tasks with extreme data scarcity (few-shot learning) remains under-explored. Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an "augmentation divergence": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions that naturally respond to both spoken language and physical objects is crucial for interactive digital experiences. Current methods, however, address speech-driven gestures or object interactions independently, limiting real-world applicability due to a lack of integrated, comprehensive datasets. To overcome this, we introduce InteracTalker, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates prompt-based object-aware interactions with co-speech gesture generation. We achieve this by employing a multi-stage training process to learn a unified motion, speech, and prompt embedding space. To support this, we curate a rich human-object interaction dataset, formed by augmenting an existing text-to-motion dataset with detailed object interaction annotations. Our framework utilizes a Generalized Motion Adaptation Module that enables independent training, adapting to the corresponding motion condition, which is then dynamically combined during inference. To address the imbalance between heterogeneous conditioning signals, we propose an adaptive fusion strategy, which dynamically reweights the conditioning signals during diffusion sampling. InteracTalker successfully unifies these previously separate tasks, outperforming prior methods in both co-speech gesture generation and object-interaction synthesis, outperforming gesture-focused diffusion methods, yielding highly realistic, object-aware full-body motions with enhanced realism, flexibility, and control.

Abstract: The proliferation of synthetic facial imagery has intensified the need for robust Open-World DeepFake Attribution (OW-DFA), which aims to attribute both known and unknown forgeries using labeled data for known types and unlabeled data containing a mixture of known and novel types. However, existing OW-DFA methods face two critical limitations: 1) A confidence skew that leads to unreliable pseudo-labels for novel forgeries, resulting in biased training. 2) An unrealistic assumption that the number of unknown forgery types is known *a priori*. To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios. Extensive experiments on the standard OW-DFA benchmark and a newly extended benchmark incorporating advanced manipulations demonstrate that CAL consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on both known and novel forgery attribution.

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation aims to dynamically adjust a network model in real-time based on sequential input samples during the inference stage. In this work, we find that, when applying a transformer network model to a new target domain, the Query, Key, and Value features of its self-attention module often change significantly from those in the source domain, leading to substantial performance degradation of the transformer model. To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of video content across online platforms has accelerated the need for retrieval systems capable of understanding not only isolated visual moments but also the temporal structure of complex events. Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. Together, these components advance the temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of modern video retrieval systems, paving the way for more semantically aware and adaptive retrieval across large-scale video corpora.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has created an urgent need for efficient multimodal moment retrieval systems. However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities.

Abstract: CLIP achieves strong zero-shot image-text retrieval by aligning global vision and text representations, yet it falls behind on fine-grained tasks even when fine-tuned on long, detailed captions. In this work, we propose $β$-CLIP, a multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning framework designed to achieve hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities-from full captions to sentences and phrases-and their corresponding visual regions. For each level of granularity, $β$-CLIP utilizes cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches, producing contextualized visual embeddings. To address the semantic overlap inherent in this hierarchy, we introduce the $β$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss ($β$-CAL). This objective parameterizes the trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft Cross-Entropy and hard Binary Cross-Entropy formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $β$-CLIP significantly improves dense alignment: achieving 91.8% T2I 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. $β$-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence. The code and models are released at https://github.com/fzohra/B-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end video compression have shown promising results owing to their unified end-to-end learning optimization. However, such generalized frameworks often lack content-specific adaptation, leading to suboptimal compression performance. To address this, this paper proposes a content adaptive based motion alignment framework that improves performance by adapting encoding strategies to diverse content characteristics. Specifically, we first introduce a two-stage flow-guided deformable warping mechanism that refines motion compensation with coarse-to-fine offset prediction and mask modulation, enabling precise feature alignment. Second, we propose a multi-reference quality aware strategy that adjusts distortion weights based on reference quality, and applies it to hierarchical training to reduce error propagation. Third, we integrate a training-free module that downsamples frames by motion magnitude and resolution to obtain smooth motion estimation. Experimental results on standard test datasets demonstrate that our framework CAMA achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art Neural Video Compression models, achieving a 24.95% BD-rate (PSNR) savings over our baseline model DCVC-TCM, while also outperforming reproduced DCVC-DC and traditional codec HM-16.25.

Abstract: CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.

Abstract: The spinal angle is an important indicator of body balance. It is important to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line. Existing mul-ti-image-based body restoration methods require expensive equipment and complex pro-cedures, and single image-based body restoration methods have limitations in that it is difficult to accurately estimate the internal structure such as the spine center line due to occlusion and viewpoint limitation. This study proposes a method to compensate for the shortcomings of the multi-image-based method and to solve the limitations of the sin-gle-image method. We propose a 3D body posture analysis system that integrates depth images from four directions to restore a 3D human model and automatically estimate the spine center line. Through hierarchical matching of global and fine registration, restora-tion to noise and occlusion is performed. Also, the Adaptive Vertex Reduction is applied to maintain the resolution and shape reliability of the mesh, and the accuracy and stabil-ity of spinal angle estimation are simultaneously secured by using the Level of Detail en-semble. The proposed method achieves high-precision 3D spine registration estimation without relying on training data or complex neural network models, and the verification confirms the improvement of matching quality.

Abstract: Multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for multi-modal agents built upon vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by sparse rewards and long-horizon credit assignment. Recent methods densify the reward by querying a teacher that provides step-level feedback, e.g., Guided Thought Reinforcement (GTR) and On-Policy Distillation, but rely on costly, often privileged models as the teacher, limiting practicality and reproducibility. We introduce GTR-Turbo, a highly efficient upgrade to GTR, which matches the performance without training or querying an expensive teacher model. Specifically, GTR-Turbo merges the weights of checkpoints produced during the ongoing RL training, and then uses this merged model as a "free" teacher to guide the subsequent RL via supervised fine-tuning or soft logit distillation. This design removes dependence on privileged VLMs (e.g., GPT or Gemini), mitigates the "entropy collapse" observed in prior work, and keeps training stable. Across diverse visual agentic tasks, GTR-Turbo improves the accuracy of the baseline model by 10-30% while reducing wall-clock training time by 50% and compute cost by 60% relative to GTR.

Abstract: Physics-aware driving world model is essential for drive planning, out-of-distribution data synthesis, and closed-loop evaluation. However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and emerging omni-modal architectures, current benchmarks remain limited in scope and integration, suffering from incomplete modality coverage, restricted interaction to text-centric outputs, and weak interdependence and complementarity among modalities. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FysicsWorld, the first unified full-modality benchmark that supports bidirectional input-output across image, video, audio, and text, enabling comprehensive any-to-any evaluation across understanding, generation, and reasoning. FysicsWorld encompasses 16 primary tasks and 3,268 curated samples, aggregated from over 40 high-quality sources and covering a rich set of open-domain categories with diverse question types. We also propose the Cross-Modal Complementarity Screening (CMCS) strategy integrated in a systematic data construction framework that produces omni-modal data for spoken interaction and fusion-dependent cross-modal reasoning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 state-of-the-art baselines, spanning MLLMs, modality-specific models, unified understanding-generation models, and omni-modal language models, FysicsWorld exposes the performance disparities and limitations across models in understanding, generation, and reasoning. Our benchmark establishes a unified foundation and strong baselines for evaluating and advancing next-generation full-modality architectures.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) identifies scene changes from multi-temporal observations and is widely used in urban development and environmental monitoring. Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD. Code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/Die-Xie/UniVCD.

Abstract: Vision foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization in medical image segmentation by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining. However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly capable of producing high-fidelity visual content, the demand for efficient, interpretable, and editable image representations has grown substantially. Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment.

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression has emerged in recent years, with condition-based frameworks outperforming traditional codecs. However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Although multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across diverse domains, their application in generating fine-grained 3D perception and prediction outputs in autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models.

Abstract: Current methods for dense 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes typically rely on pairwise processing, require known camera poses, or assume a temporal ordering to input frames, constraining their flexibility and applicability. Additionally, recent advances have successfully enabled efficient 3D reconstruction from large-scale, unposed image collections, underscoring opportunities for unified approaches to dynamic scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads. Crucially, DePT3R operates without requiring camera poses, substantially enhancing its adaptability and efficiency-especially important in dynamic environments with rapid changes. We validate DePT3R on several challenging benchmarks involving dynamic scenes, demonstrating strong performance and significant improvements in memory efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods. Data and codes are available via the open repository: https://github.com/StructuresComp/DePT3R

Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans. Our framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods.

Abstract: We introduce Intrinsic Image Fusion, a method that reconstructs high-quality physically based materials from multi-view images. Material reconstruction is highly underconstrained and typically relies on analysis-by-synthesis, which requires expensive and noisy path tracing. To better constrain the optimization, we incorporate single-view priors into the reconstruction process. We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in material disentanglement on both synthetic and real scenes, producing sharp and clean reconstructions suitable for high-quality relighting.

Abstract: The development of clinical-grade artificial intelligence in pathology is limited by the scarcity of diverse, high-quality annotated datasets. Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.

Abstract: Joint editing of audio and visual content is crucial for precise and controllable content creation. This new task poses challenges due to the limitations of paired audio-visual data before and after targeted edits, and the heterogeneity across modalities. To address the data and modeling challenges in joint audio-visual editing, we introduce SAVEBench, a paired audiovisual dataset with text and mask conditions to enable object-grounded source-to-target learning. With SAVEBench, we train the Schrodinger Audio-Visual Editor (SAVE), an end-to-end flow-matching model that edits audio and video in parallel while keeping them aligned throughout processing. SAVE incorporates a Schrodinger Bridge that learns a direct transport from source to target audiovisual mixtures. Our evaluation demonstrates that the proposed SAVE model is able to remove the target objects in audio and visual content while preserving the remaining content, with stronger temporal synchronization and audiovisual semantic correspondence compared with pairwise combinations of an audio editor and a video editor.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, they still struggle with (1) physical alignment and (2) out-of-distribution (OOD) instruction following. We argue that these issues stem from the models' failure to learn causal directions and to disentangle causal factors for novel recombination. We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics. Third, visual causal structure is disproportionately established during the initial, computationally limited denoising steps. Based on these findings, we introduce LINA (Learning INterventions Adaptively), a novel framework that learns to predict prompt-specific interventions, which employs (1) targeted guidance in the prompt and visual latent spaces, and (2) a reallocated, causality-aware denoising schedule. Our approach enforces both physical alignment and OOD instruction following in image and video DMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging causal generation tasks and the Winoground dataset.

Abstract: In automotive sensor fusion systems, smart sensors and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) modules are commonly utilized. Sensor data from these systems are typically available only as processed object lists rather than raw sensor data from traditional sensors. Instead of processing other raw data separately and then fusing them at the object level, we propose an end-to-end cross-level fusion concept with Transformer, which integrates highly abstract object list information with raw camera images for 3D object detection. Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives. As the first work to conduct cross-level fusion, our approach shows substantial performance improvements over the vision-based baseline on the nuScenes dataset. It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors.

Abstract: Face recognition systems rely on learning highly discriminative and compact identity clusters to enable accurate retrieval. However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility.

Abstract: 3D medical image classification is essential for modern clinical workflows. Medical foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for scaling to new tasks, yet current research suffers from three critical pitfalls: data-regime bias, suboptimal adaptation, and insufficient task coverage. In this paper, we address these pitfalls and introduce AnyMC3D, a scalable 3D classifier adapted from 2D FMs. Our method scales efficiently to new tasks by adding only lightweight plugins (about 1M parameters per task) on top of a single frozen backbone. This versatile framework also supports multi-view inputs, auxiliary pixel-level supervision, and interpretable heatmap generation. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 12 tasks covering diverse pathologies, anatomies, and modalities, and systematically analyze state-of-the-art 3D classification techniques. Our analysis reveals key insights: (1) effective adaptation is essential to unlock FM potential, (2) general-purpose FMs can match medical-specific FMs if properly adapted, and (3) 2D-based methods surpass 3D architectures for 3D classification. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse applications using a single scalable framework (including 1st place in the VLM3D challenge), eliminating the need for separate task-specific models.

Abstract: Accurately learning high-frequency signals is a challenge in computer vision and graphics, as neural networks often struggle with these signals due to spectral bias or optimization difficulties. While current techniques like Fourier encodings have made great strides in improving performance, there remains scope for improvement when presented with high-frequency information. This paper introduces Queried-Convolutions (Qonvolutions), a simple yet powerful modification using the neighborhood properties of convolution. Qonvolution convolves a low-frequency signal with queries (such as coordinates) to enhance the learning of intricate high-frequency signals. We empirically demonstrate that Qonvolutions enhance performance across a variety of high-frequency learning tasks crucial to both the computer vision and graphics communities, including 1D regression, 2D super-resolution, 2D image regression, and novel view synthesis (NVS). In particular, by combining Gaussian splatting with Qonvolutions for NVS, we showcase state-of-the-art performance on real-world complex scenes, even outperforming powerful radiance field models on image quality.

Abstract: Semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SCOOD) is a recently proposed realistic OOD detection setting: given labeled in-distribution (ID) data and mixed in-distribution and out-of-distribution unlabeled data as the training data, SCOOD aims to enable the trained model to accurately identify OOD samples in the testing data. Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination. In addition, we also introduce a retraining strategy to help the model fully fit the selected auxiliary ID/OOD samples. Experiments on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Abstract: Purpose: Intraoperative navigation in spine surgery demands millimeter-level accuracy. Current systems based on intraoperative radiographic imaging and bone-anchored markers are invasive, radiation-intensive and workflow disruptive. Recent markerless RGB-D registration methods offer a promising alternative, but existing approaches rely on weak segmentation labels to isolate relevant anatomical structures, which can propagate errors throughout registration. Methods: We present End2Reg an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly optimizes segmentation and registration, eliminating the need for weak segmentation labels and manual steps. The network learns segmentation masks specifically optimized for registration, guided solely by the registration objective without direct segmentation supervision. Results: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on ex- and in-vivo benchmarks, reducing median Target Registration Error by 32% to 1.83mm and mean Root Mean Square Error by 45% to 3.95mm, respectively. An ablation study confirms that end-to-end optimization significantly improves registration accuracy. Conclusion: The presented end-to-end RGB-D registration pipeline removes dependency on weak labels and manual steps, advancing towards fully automatic, markerless intraoperative navigation.

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is an important and challenging task in open-world learning. Specifically, given some labeled data of known classes, GCD aims to cluster unlabeled data that contain both known and unknown classes. Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks.

Abstract: Building extraction from remote sensing images is a challenging task due to the complex structure variations of the buildings. Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/Dstate/UAGLNet

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for style transfer, yet they struggle with photo-realistic transfers, often producing painting-like results or missing detailed stylistic elements. Current methods inadequately address unwanted influence from original content styles and style reference content features. We introduce SCAdapter, a novel technique leveraging CLIP image space to effectively separate and integrate content and style features. Our key innovation systematically extracts pure content from content images and style elements from style references, ensuring authentic transfers. This approach is enhanced through three components: Controllable Style Adaptive Instance Normalization (CSAdaIN) for precise multi-style blending, KVS Injection for targeted style integration, and a style transfer consistency objective maintaining process coherence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate SCAdapter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both conventional and diffusion-based baselines. By eliminating DDIM inversion and inference-stage optimization, our method achieves at least $2\times$ faster inference than other diffusion-based approaches, making it both more effective and efficient for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent deep learning frameworks in histopathology, particularly multiple instance learning (MIL) combined with pathology foundational models (PFMs), have shown strong performance. However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents VLCache, a cache reuse framework that exploits both Key-Value (KV) cache and encoder cache from prior multimodal inputs to eliminate costly recomputation when the same multimodal inputs recur. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, we formally identify the cumulative reuse error effect and demonstrate how to minimize the non-prefix cache reuse error effectively. We further analyze the varying importance of model layers and propose a dynamic, layer-aware recomputation strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that VLCache achieves an accuracy on par with full recomputation, while requiring only 2-5% of the tokens to compute, yielding 1.2x-16x TTFT speedups. The proposed VLCache pipeline has been integrated into SGLang, enabling significantly faster inference in practical deployments.

Abstract: The pursuit of a universal AI-generated image (AIGI) detector often relies on aggregating data from numerous generators to improve generalization. However, this paper identifies a paradoxical phenomenon we term the Benefit then Conflict dilemma, where detector performance stagnates and eventually degrades as source diversity expands. Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that GAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing superior detection accuracy across a wide variety of GAN and diffusion-based generators.

Abstract: Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

Abstract: Diffusion distillation has dramatically accelerated class-conditional image synthesis, but its applicability to open-ended text-to-image (T2I) generation is still unclear. We present the first systematic study that adapts and compares state-of-the-art distillation techniques on a strong T2I teacher model, FLUX.1-lite. By casting existing methods into a unified framework, we identify the key obstacles that arise when moving from discrete class labels to free-form language prompts. Beyond a thorough methodological analysis, we offer practical guidelines on input scaling, network architecture, and hyperparameters, accompanied by an open-source implementation and pretrained student models. Our findings establish a solid foundation for deploying fast, high-fidelity, and resource-efficient diffusion generators in real-world T2I applications.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising process. Our model can generate multi-modal preview representations that include RGB and scene intrinsics at more than 4$\times$ real-time speed (less than 1 second for a 4-second video) that convey consistent appearance and motion to the final video. With the trained decoder, we show that it is possible to interactively guide the generation at intermediate noise steps via stochasticity reinjection and modal steering, unlocking a new control capability. Moreover, we systematically probe the model using the learned decoders, revealing how scene, object, and other details are composed and assembled during the otherwise black-box denoising process.

Abstract: Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

Abstract: Accurate medical image analysis can greatly assist clinical diagnosis, but its effectiveness relies on high-quality expert annotations Obtaining pixel-level labels for medical images, particularly fundus images, remains costly and time-consuming. Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis.

Abstract: Given the inherently costly and time-intensive nature of pixel-level annotation, the generation of synthetic datasets comprising sufficiently diverse synthetic images paired with ground-truth pixel-level annotations has garnered increasing attention recently for training high-performance semantic segmentation models. However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Recent unified models for joint understanding and generation have significantly advanced visual generation capabilities. However, their focus on conventional tasks like text-to-video generation has left the temporal reasoning potential of unified models largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Next Scene Prediction (NSP), a new task that pushes unified video models toward temporal and causal reasoning. Unlike text-to-video generation, NSP requires predicting plausible futures from preceding context, demanding deeper understanding and reasoning. To tackle this task, we propose a unified framework combining Qwen-VL for comprehension and LTX for synthesis, bridged by a latent query embedding and a connector module. This model is trained in three stages on our newly curated, large-scale NSP dataset: text-to-video pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning (via GRPO) with our proposed causal consistency reward. Experiments demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark, advancing the capability of generalist multimodal systems to anticipate what happens next.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of spatial generalization techniques, which are essential for the practical deployment of deep learning-based radio-frequency (RF) sensing. Focusing on people counting in indoor environments using frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar, we systematically investigate a broad set of approaches, including amplitude-based statistical preprocessing (sigmoid weighting and threshold zeroing), frequency-domain filtering, autoencoder-based background suppression, data augmentation strategies, and transfer learning. Experimental results collected across two environments with different layouts demonstrate that sigmoid-based amplitude weighting consistently achieves superior cross-environment performance, yielding 50.1% and 55.2% reductions in root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively, compared with baseline methods. Data augmentation provides additional though modest benefits, with improvements up to 8.8% in MAE. By contrast, transfer learning proves indispensable for large spatial shifts, achieving 82.1% and 91.3% reductions in RMSE and MAE, respectively, with 540 target-domain samples. Taken together, these findings establish a highly practical direction for developing radar sensing systems capable of maintaining robust accuracy under spatial variations by integrating deep learning models with amplitude-based preprocessing and efficient transfer learning.

Abstract: Instructional video generation is an emerging task that aims to synthesize coherent demonstrations of procedural activities from textual descriptions. Such capability has broad implications for content creation, education, and human-AI interaction, yet existing video diffusion models struggle to maintain temporal consistency and controllability across long sequences of multiple action steps. We introduce a pipeline for future-driven streaming instructional video generation, dubbed SneakPeek, a diffusion-based autoregressive framework designed to generate precise, stepwise instructional videos conditioned on an initial image and structured textual prompts. Our approach introduces three key innovations to enhance consistency and controllability: (1) predictive causal adaptation, where a causal model learns to perform next-frame prediction and anticipate future keyframes; (2) future-guided self-forcing with a dual-region KV caching scheme to address the exposure bias issue at inference time; (3) multi-prompt conditioning, which provides fine-grained and procedural control over multi-step instructions. Together, these components mitigate temporal drift, preserve motion consistency, and enable interactive video generation where future prompt updates dynamically influence ongoing streaming video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces temporally coherent and semantically faithful instructional videos that accurately follow complex, multi-step task descriptions.

Abstract: While a general embodied agent must function as a unified system, current methods are built on isolated models for understanding, world modeling, and control. This fragmentation prevents unifying multimodal generative capabilities and hinders learning from large-scale, heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose Motus, a unified latent action world model that leverages existing general pretrained models and rich, sharable motion information. Motus introduces a Mixture-of-Transformer (MoT) architecture to integrate three experts (i.e., understanding, video generation, and action) and adopts a UniDiffuser-style scheduler to enable flexible switching between different modeling modes (i.e., world models, vision-language-action models, inverse dynamics models, video generation models, and video-action joint prediction models). Motus further leverages the optical flow to learn latent actions and adopts a recipe with three-phase training pipeline and six-layer data pyramid, thereby extracting pixel-level "delta action" and enabling large-scale action pretraining. Experiments show that Motus achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation (a +15% improvement over X-VLA and a +45% improvement over Pi0.5) and real-world scenarios(improved by +11~48%), demonstrating unified modeling of all functionalities and priors significantly benefits downstream robotic tasks.

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive comparison of rule-based methods, traditional machine learning models, and deep learning models in radio wave sensing with frequency modulated continuous wave multiple input multiple output radar. We systematically evaluated five approaches in two indoor environments with distinct layouts: a rule-based connected component method; three traditional machine learning models, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine; and a deep learning model combining a convolutional neural network and long short term memory. In the training environment, the convolutional neural network long short term memory model achieved the highest accuracy, while traditional machine learning models provided moderate performance. In a new layout, however, all learning based methods showed significant degradation, whereas the rule-based method remained stable. Notably, for binary detection of presence versus absence of people, all models consistently achieved high accuracy across layouts. These results demonstrate that high capacity models can produce fine grained outputs with high accuracy in the same environment, but they are vulnerable to domain shift. In contrast, rule-based methods cannot provide fine grained outputs but exhibit robustness against domain shift. Moreover, regardless of the model type, a clear trade off was revealed between spatial generalization performance and output granularity.

Abstract: Concept erasure, which fine-tunes diffusion models to remove undesired or harmful visual concepts, has become a mainstream approach to mitigating unsafe or illegal image generation in text-to-image models.However, existing removal methods typically adopt a unidirectional erasure strategy by either suppressing the target concept or reinforcing safe alternatives, making it difficult to achieve a balanced trade-off between concept removal and generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has advanced significantly with high-capacity foundation models like DINOv2, achieving remarkable performance. Nonetheless, their substantial computational cost makes deployment on resource-constrained devices impractical. In this paper, we introduce an efficient asymmetric VPR framework that incorporates a high-capacity gallery model for offline feature extraction with a lightweight query network for online processing. A key challenge in this setting is ensuring compatibility between these heterogeneous networks, which conventional approaches address through computationally expensive k-NN-based compatible training. To overcome this, we propose a geographical memory bank that structures gallery features using geolocation metadata inherent in VPR databases, eliminating the need for exhaustive k-NN computations. Additionally, we introduce an implicit embedding augmentation technique that enhances the query network to model feature variations despite its limited capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only significantly reduces computational costs but also outperforms existing asymmetric retrieval techniques, establishing a new aspect for VPR in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Multimodal biomedical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit immense potential in the field of Continual Learning (CL). However, they confront a core dilemma: how to preserve fine-grained intra-modality features while bridging the significant domain gap across different modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework. Leveraging our 18-million multimodal and comprehensive medical retrieval database derived from PubMed scientific papers, we pioneer the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into CL. Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: In Dataset Condensation, the goal is to synthesize a small dataset that replicates the training utility of a large original dataset.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the addition of our regularizer improves state-of-the-art condensation methods on various benchmark datasets from CIFAR-10 to ImageNet-1K with respect to generalization and diversity metrics.

Abstract: To combine the advantages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), recent methods have integrated ''hints'' into post-training, which are prefix segments of complete reasoning trajectories, aiming for powerful knowledge expansion and reasoning generalization. However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8. Our code and dataset will be made publicly available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Forest pests threaten ecosystem stability, requiring efficient monitoring. To overcome the limitations of traditional methods in large-scale, fine-grained detection, this study focuses on accurately identifying infected trees and analyzing infestation patterns. We propose FID-Net, a deep learning model that detects pest-affected trees from UAV visible-light imagery and enables infestation analysis via three spatial metrics. Based on YOLOv8n, FID-Net introduces a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM) to extract disease-sensitive cues, an Adaptive Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module (AMFM) to align and fuse dual-branch features (RGB and FEM-enhanced), and an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) mechanism to enhance discriminative information efficiently. From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models. Analysis confirms infected trees exhibit clear clustering, supporting targeted forest protection. FID-Net enables accurate tree health discrimination and, combined with spatial metrics, provides reliable data for intelligent pest monitoring, early warning, and precise management.

Abstract: High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping.

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.

Abstract: The problem of depth completion involves predicting a dense depth image from a single sparse depth map and an RGB image. Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation requires a holistic understanding of the physical world, as it assigns semantic labels to spatially continuous and structurally coherent objects rather than to isolated pixels. However, existing data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) methods-primarily designed for classification-often disregard this continuity, resulting in significant performance degradation when applied directly to segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce DFSS, a novel data-free distillation framework tailored for semantic segmentation. Unlike prior approaches that treat pixels independently, DFSS respects the structural and contextual continuity of real-world scenes. Our key insight is to leverage Batch Normalization (BN) statistics from a teacher model to guide Approximate Distribution Sampling (ADS), enabling the selection of data that better reflects the original training distribution-without relying on potentially misleading teacher predictions. Additionally, we propose Weighted Distribution Progressive Distillation (WDPD), which dynamically prioritizes reliable samples that are more closely aligned with the original data distribution early in training and gradually incorporates more challenging cases, mirroring the natural progression of learning in human perception. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DFSS consistently outperforms existing data-free distillation methods for semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly reduced reliance on auxiliary data.

Abstract: Vision-language models enable the understanding and reasoning of complex traffic scenarios through multi-source information fusion, establishing it as a core technology for autonomous driving. However, existing vision-language models are constrained by the image understanding paradigm in 2D plane, which restricts their capability to perceive 3D spatial information and perform deep semantic fusion, resulting in suboptimal performance in complex autonomous driving environments. This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

Abstract: Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.

Abstract: Face relighting aims to synthesize realistic portraits under novel illumination while preserving identity and geometry. However, progress remains constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, physically consistent illumination data. To address this, we introduce POLAR, a large-scale and physically calibrated One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) dataset containing over 200 subjects captured under 156 lighting directions, multiple views, and diverse expressions. Building upon POLAR, we develop a flow-based generative model POLARNet that predicts per-light OLAT responses from a single portrait, capturing fine-grained and direction-aware illumination effects while preserving facial identity. Unlike diffusion or background-conditioned methods that rely on statistical or contextual cues, our formulation models illumination as a continuous, physically interpretable transformation between lighting states, enabling scalable and controllable relighting. Together, POLAR and POLARNet form a unified illumination learning framework that links real data, generative synthesis, and physically grounded relighting, establishing a self-sustaining "chicken-and-egg" cycle for scalable and reproducible portrait illumination.

Abstract: We present Ego-EXTRA, a video-language Egocentric Dataset for EXpert-TRAinee assistance. Ego-EXTRA features 50 hours of unscripted egocentric videos of subjects performing procedural activities (the trainees) while guided by real-world experts who provide guidance and answer specific questions using natural language. Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models. The results show that Ego-EXTRA is challenging and highlight the limitations of current models when used to provide expert-level assistance to the user. The Ego-EXTRA dataset is publicly available to support the benchmark of egocentric video-language assistants: https://fpv-iplab.github.io/Ego-EXTRA/.

Abstract: This paper presents STARCaster, an identity-aware spatio-temporal video diffusion model that addresses both speech-driven portrait animation and free-viewpoint talking portrait synthesis, given an identity embedding or reference image, within a unified framework. Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STARCaster generalizes effectively across tasks and identities, consistently surpassing prior approaches in different benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at visual question answering (VQA) but remain limited to snapshot vision, reasoning from static images. In contrast, embodied agents require ambulatory vision, actively moving to obtain more informative views. We introduce Visually Grounded Active View Selection (VG-AVS), a task that selects the most informative next viewpoint using only the visual information in the current image, without relying on scene memory or external knowledge. To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts. We also propose a framework that fine-tunes pretrained VLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by RL-based policy optimization. Our approach achieves strong question answering performance based on viewpoint selection and generalizes robustly to unseen synthetic and real scenes. Furthermore, incorporating our learned VG-AVS framework into existing scene-exploration-based EQA systems improves downstream question-answering accuracy.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing with diffusion models has achieved impressive results, yet existing methods struggle with fine-grained instructions specifying precise attributes such as colors, positions, and quantities. While recent approaches employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for alignment, they optimize only at individual sampling steps, providing sparse feedback that limits trajectory-level control. We propose a unified framework CogniEdit, combining multi-modal reasoning with dense reward optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive denoising steps, enabling trajectory-level gradient flow through the sampling process. Our method comprises three components: (1) Multi-modal Large Language Models for decomposing complex instructions into actionable directives, (2) Dynamic Token Focus Relocation that adaptively emphasizes fine-grained attributes, and (3) Dense GRPO-based optimization that propagates gradients across consecutive steps for trajectory-level supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CogniEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance in balancing fine-grained instruction following with visual quality and editability preservation

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have produced vivid content that are often indistinguishable from real videos, making AI-generated video detection an emerging societal challenge. Prior AIGC detection benchmarks mostly evaluate video without audio, target broad narrative domains, and focus on classification solely. Yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art video generation models can produce immersive, audio-paired videos that reliably deceive humans and VLMs. To this end, we introduce Video Reality Test, an ASMR-sourced video benchmark suite for testing perceptual realism under tight audio-visual coupling, featuring the following dimensions: \textbf{(i) Immersive ASMR video-audio sources.} Built on carefully curated real ASMR videos, the benchmark targets fine-grained action-object interactions with diversity across objects, actions, and backgrounds. \textbf{(ii) Peer-Review evaluation.} An adversarial creator-reviewer protocol where video generation models act as creators aiming to fool reviewers, while VLMs serve as reviewers seeking to identify fakeness. Our experimental findings show: The best creator Veo3.1-Fast even fools most VLMs: the strongest reviewer (Gemini 2.5-Pro) achieves only 56\% accuracy (random 50\%), far below that of human experts (81.25\%). Adding audio improves real-fake discrimination, yet superficial cues such as watermarks can still significantly mislead models. These findings delineate the current boundary of video generation realism and expose limitations of VLMs in perceptual fidelity and audio-visual consistency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has increased the demand for generated image detectors capable of generalizing across diverse and evolving generation techniques. However, existing methods, including those leveraging pre-trained vision-language models, often produce highly entangled representations, mixing task-relevant forensic cues (causal features) with spurious or irrelevant patterns (non-causal features), thus limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts. When tested on unseen generative models from different series, CausalCLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability, achieving improvements of 6.83% in accuracy and 4.06% in average precision over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While existing generation and unified models excel at general image generation, they struggle with tasks requiring deep reasoning, planning, and precise data-to-visual mapping abilities beyond general scenarios. To push beyond the existing limitations, we introduce a new and challenging task: creative table visualization, requiring the model to generate an infographic that faithfully and aesthetically visualizes the data from a given table. To address this challenge, we propose ShowTable, a pipeline that synergizes MLLMs with diffusion models via a progressive self-correcting process. The MLLM acts as the central orchestrator for reasoning the visual plan and judging visual errors to provide refined instructions, the diffusion execute the commands from MLLM, achieving high-fidelity results. To support this task and our pipeline, we introduce three automated data construction pipelines for training different modules. Furthermore, we introduce TableVisBench, a new benchmark with 800 challenging instances across 5 evaluation dimensions, to assess performance on this task. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline, instantiated with different models, significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effective multi-modal reasoning, generation, and error correction capabilities.

Abstract: Avatar video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prior work exhibits limited efficiency in generating long-duration high-resolution videos, suffering from temporal drifting, quality degradation, and weak prompt following as video length increases. To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts. These experts reason about modality priorities and infer underlying user intent, converting inputs into detailed storylines through multi-turn dialogue. A Negative Director further refines negative prompts to improve instruction alignment. Building on these components, we extend the framework to support ID-specific multi-character control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively addresses the challenges of efficient, multimodally aligned long-form high-resolution video generation, delivering enhanced visual clarity, realistic lip-teeth rendering with accurate lip synchronization, strong identity preservation, and coherent multimodal instruction following.

Abstract: The article analyzes the use of thermal imaging technologies for biometric identification based on facial thermograms. It presents a comparative analysis of infrared spectral ranges (NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR). The paper also defines key requirements for thermal cameras used in biometric systems, including sensor resolution, thermal sensitivity, and a frame rate of at least 30 Hz. Siamese neural networks are proposed as an effective approach for automating the identification process. In experiments conducted on a proprietary dataset, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of approximately 80%. The study also examines the potential of hybrid systems that combine visible and infrared spectra to overcome the limitations of individual modalities. The results indicate that thermal imaging is a promising technology for developing reliable security systems.

Abstract: Automatic polyp segmentation is crucial for improving the clinical identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). While Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been extensively researched for this problem, current methods frequently struggle with generalization, particularly in data-constrained or challenging settings. Moreover, many existing polyp segmentation methods rely on complex, task-specific architectures. To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention "key" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability. We validate our approach using a multi-center dataset under two rigorous protocols: Domain Generalization (DG) and Extreme Single Domain Generalization (ESDG). Our results, supported by a comprehensive statistical analysis, demonstrate that this pipeline achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly enhancing generalization, particularly in data-scarce and challenging scenarios. While avoiding a polyp-specific architecture, we surpass well-established models like nnU-Net and UM-Net. Additionally, we provide a systematic benchmark of the DINO framework's evolution, quantifying the specific impact of architectural advancements on downstream polyp segmentation performance.

Abstract: We address image-to-video generation with explicit user control over the final frame's disoccluded regions. Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables. Our method mixes generative control, in the form of loose pose and structure, with predictable controls, in the form of appearance specification in the final frame in the disoccluded regions, unlocking a new image-to-video workflow. Code will be released on acceptance. Project page: https://anranqi.github.io/beyondvisible.github.io/

Abstract: Accurately predicting topologically correct masks remains a difficult task for general segmentation models, which often produce fragmented or disconnected outputs. Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively. This showcases NCA as effective and broadly applicable refiners.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel pipeline for generating large-scale, highly realistic, and automatically labeled datasets for computer vision tasks in robotic environments. Our approach addresses the critical challenges of the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery and the time-consuming bottleneck of manual annotation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create photorealistic representations of the operational environment and objects. These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism. Pixel-perfect segmentation masks are generated automatically and formatted for direct use with object detection models like YOLO. Our experiments show that a hybrid training strategy, combining a small set of real images with a large volume of our synthetic data, yields the best detection and segmentation performance, confirming this as an optimal strategy for efficiently achieving robust and accurate models.

Abstract: Continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) requires precise spatio-temporal modeling to accurately recognize sequences of gestures in videos. Existing frameworks often rely on CNN-based spatial backbones combined with temporal convolution or recurrent modules. These techniques fail in capturing fine-grained hand and facial cues and modeling long-range temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Unified Spatio-Temporal Modeling (USTM) framework, a spatio-temporal encoder that effectively models complex patterns using a combination of a Swin Transformer backbone enhanced with lightweight temporal adapter with positional embeddings (TAPE). Our framework captures fine-grained spatial features alongside short and long-term temporal context, enabling robust sign language recognition from RGB videos without relying on multi-stream inputs or auxiliary modalities. Extensive experiments on benchmarked datasets including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily demonstrate that USTM achieves state-of-the-art performance against RGB-based as well as multi-modal CSLR approaches, while maintaining competitive performance against multi-stream approaches. These results highlight the strength and efficacy of the USTM framework for CSLR. The code is available at https://github.com/gufranSabri/USTM

Abstract: Unexploitable example generation aims to transform personal images into their unexploitable (unlearnable) versions before they are uploaded online, thereby preventing unauthorized exploitation of online personal images. Recently, this task has garnered significant research attention due to its critical relevance to personal data privacy. Yet, despite recent progress, existing methods for this task can still suffer from limited practical applicability, as they can fail to generate examples that are broadly unexploitable across different real-world computer vision tasks. To deal with this problem, in this work, we propose a novel Meta Cross-Task Unexploitable Example Generation (MCT-UEG) framework. At the core of our framework, to optimize the unexploitable example generator for effectively producing broadly unexploitable examples, we design a flat-minima-oriented meta training and testing scheme. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our framework.

Abstract: Visual tokenizers play a crucial role in diffusion models. The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure. Furthermore, as the latent dimensionality increases, we observe consistent improvements. Code and model are available at https://shi-qingyu.github.io/rectok.github.io.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models generate images based on text prompts, which often leave certain aspects of the desired image ambiguous. When faced with these ambiguities, TTI models have been shown to exhibit biases in their interpretations. These biases can have societal impacts, e.g., when showing only a certain race for a stated occupation. They can also affect user experience when creating redundancy within a set of generated images instead of spanning diverse possibilities. Here, we introduce MineTheGap - a method for automatically mining prompts that cause a TTI model to generate biased outputs. Our method goes beyond merely detecting bias for a given prompt. Rather, it leverages a genetic algorithm to iteratively refine a pool of prompts, seeking for those that expose biases. This optimization process is driven by a novel bias score, which ranks biases according to their severity, as we validate on a dataset with known biases. For a given prompt, this score is obtained by comparing the distribution of generated images to the distribution of LLM-generated texts that constitute variations on the prompt. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of plant leaf diseases is essential for resilient and sustainable agriculture, yet most deep learning approaches rely on large annotated datasets and computationally intensive models that are unsuitable for data-scarce and resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges we present a few-shot learning approach within a lightweight yet efficient framework that combines domain-adapted MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 models as feature extractors, along with a feature fusion technique to generate robust feature representation. For the classification task, the fused features are passed through a Bi-LSTM classifier enhanced with attention mechanisms to capture sequential dependencies and focus on the most relevant features, thereby achieving optimal classification performance even in complex, real-world environments with noisy or cluttered backgrounds. The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds. Notably, it also outperformed the previous SOTA accuracy of 96.0% on six diseases from PlantVillage, achieving 99.72% with only 15-shot learning.

Abstract: As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.

Abstract: Generative foundation models contain broad visual knowledge and can produce diverse image variations, making them particularly promising for advancing domain generalization tasks. While they can be used for training data augmentation, synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations remains slow, expensive, and incomplete. We propose an alternative: using diffusion models at test time to map target images back to the source distribution where the downstream model was trained. This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions. Our analysis spans multiple generative and downstream models, including an ensemble variant for enhanced robustness. The method achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich.

Abstract: Pose-guided video generation refers to controlling the motion of subjects in generated video through a sequence of poses. It enables precise control over subject motion and has important applications in animation. However, current pose-guided video generation methods are limited to accepting only human poses as input, thus generalizing poorly to pose of other subjects. To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Native 4K (2160$\times$3840) video generation remains a critical challenge due to the quadratic computational explosion of full-attention as spatiotemporal resolution increases, making it difficult for models to strike a balance between efficiency and quality. This paper proposes a novel Transformer retrofit strategy termed $\textbf{T3}$ ($\textbf{T}$ransform $\textbf{T}$rained $\textbf{T}$ransformer) that, without altering the core architecture of full-attention pretrained models, significantly reduces compute requirements by optimizing their forward logic. Specifically, $\textbf{T3-Video}$ introduces a multi-scale weight-sharing window attention mechanism and, via hierarchical blocking together with an axis-preserving full-attention design, can effect an "attention pattern" transformation of a pretrained model using only modest compute and data. Results on 4K-VBench show that $\textbf{T3-Video}$ substantially outperforms existing approaches: while delivering performance improvements (+4.29$\uparrow$ VQA and +0.08$\uparrow$ VTC), it accelerates native 4K video generation by more than 10$\times$.

Abstract: We propose a multimodal-driven framework for high-fidelity long-term digital human animation termed $\textbf{Soul}$, which generates semantically coherent videos from a single-frame portrait image, text prompts, and audio, achieving precise lip synchronization, vivid facial expressions, and robust identity preservation. We construct Soul-1M, containing 1 million finely annotated samples with a precise automated annotation pipeline (covering portrait, upper-body, full-body, and multi-person scenes) to mitigate data scarcity, and we carefully curate Soul-Bench for comprehensive and fair evaluation of audio-/text-guided animation methods. The model is built on the Wan2.2-5B backbone, integrating audio-injection layers and multiple training strategies together with threshold-aware codebook replacement to ensure long-term generation consistency. Meanwhile, step/CFG distillation and a lightweight VAE are used to optimize inference efficiency, achieving an 11.4$\times$ speedup with negligible quality loss. Extensive experiments show that Soul significantly outperforms current leading open-source and commercial models on video quality, video-text alignment, identity preservation, and lip-synchronization accuracy, demonstrating broad applicability in real-world scenarios such as virtual anchors and film production.

Abstract: Our objective is to build a general time-aware video-text embedding model for retrieval. To that end, we propose a simple and efficient recipe, dubbed TARA (Time Aware Retrieval Adaptation), to adapt Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to a time-aware video-text embedding model without using any video data at all. For evaluating time-awareness in retrieval, we propose a new benchmark with temporally opposite (chiral) actions as hard negatives and curated splits for chiral and non-chiral actions. We show that TARA outperforms all existing video-text models on this chiral benchmark while also achieving strong results on standard benchmarks. Furthermore, we discover additional benefits of TARA beyond time-awareness: (i) TARA embeddings are negation-aware as shown in NegBench benchmark that evaluates negation in video retrieval, (ii) TARA achieves state of the art performance on verb and adverb understanding in videos. Overall, TARA yields a strong, versatile, time-aware video-text embedding model with state of the art zero-shot performance.

Abstract: A single biomedical image can be meaningfully segmented in multiple ways, depending on the desired application. For instance, a brain MRI can be segmented according to tissue types, vascular territories, broad anatomical regions, fine-grained anatomy, or pathology, etc. Existing automatic segmentation models typically either (1) support only a single protocol, the one they were trained on, or (2) require labor-intensive manual prompting to specify the desired segmentation. We introduce Pancakes, a framework that, given a new image from a previously unseen domain, automatically generates multi-label segmentation maps for multiple plausible protocols, while maintaining semantic consistency across related images. Pancakes introduces a new problem formulation that is not currently attainable by existing foundation models. In a series of experiments on seven held-out datasets, we demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform existing foundation models in producing several plausible whole-image segmentations, that are semantically coherent across images.

Abstract: Human-centric anomaly detection (AD) has been primarily studied to specify anomalous behaviors in a single person. However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD.

Abstract: The ability to perform multi-modal multi-hop reasoning by iteratively integrating information across various modalities and external knowledge is critical for addressing complex real-world challenges. However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area.

Abstract: We present Lighting in Motion (LiMo), a diffusion-based approach to spatiotemporal lighting estimation. LiMo targets both realistic high-frequency detail prediction and accurate illuminance estimation. To account for both, we propose generating a set of mirrored and diffuse spheres at different exposures, based on their 3D positions in the input. Making use of diffusion priors, we fine-tune powerful existing diffusion models on a large-scale customized dataset of indoor and outdoor scenes, paired with spatiotemporal light probes. For accurate spatial conditioning, we demonstrate that depth alone is insufficient and we introduce a new geometric condition to provide the relative position of the scene to the target 3D position. Finally, we combine diffuse and mirror predictions at different exposures into a single HDRI map leveraging differentiable rendering. We thoroughly evaluate our method and design choices to establish LiMo as state-of-the-art for both spatial control and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Building video world models upon pretrained video generation systems represents an important yet challenging step toward general spatiotemporal intelligence. A world model should possess three essential properties: controllability, long-term visual quality, and temporal consistency. To this end, we take a progressive approach-first enhancing controllability and then extending toward long-term, high-quality generation. We present LongVie 2, an end-to-end autoregressive framework trained in three stages: (1) Multi-modal guidance, which integrates dense and sparse control signals to provide implicit world-level supervision and improve controllability; (2) Degradation-aware training on the input frame, bridging the gap between training and long-term inference to maintain high visual quality; and (3) History-context guidance, which aligns contextual information across adjacent clips to ensure temporal consistency. We further introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 high-resolution one-minute videos covering diverse real-world and synthetic environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LongVie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, temporal coherence, and visual fidelity, and supports continuous video generation lasting up to five minutes, marking a significant step toward unified video world modeling.

Abstract: Foundation models have shown promise in medical imaging but remain underexplored for three-dimensional imaging modalities. No foundation model currently exists for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT), despite its use for breast cancer screening.
  To develop and evaluate a foundation model for DBT (DBT-DINO) across multiple clinical tasks and assess the impact of domain-specific pre-training.
  Self-supervised pre-training was performed using the DINOv2 methodology on over 25 million 2D slices from 487,975 DBT volumes from 27,990 patients. Three downstream tasks were evaluated: (1) breast density classification using 5,000 screening exams; (2) 5-year risk of developing breast cancer using 106,417 screening exams; and (3) lesion detection using 393 annotated volumes.
  For breast density classification, DBT-DINO achieved an accuracy of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.81), outperforming both the MetaAI DINOv2 baseline (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.70--0.76, p<.001) and DenseNet-121 (0.74, 95\% CI: 0.71--0.76, p<.001). For 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, DBT-DINO achieved an AUROC of 0.78 (95\% CI: 0.76--0.80) compared to DINOv2's 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.74--0.78, p=.57). For lesion detection, DINOv2 achieved a higher average sensitivity of 0.67 (95\% CI: 0.60--0.74) compared to DBT-DINO with 0.62 (95\% CI: 0.53--0.71, p=.60). DBT-DINO demonstrated better performance on cancerous lesions specifically with a detection rate of 78.8\% compared to Dinov2's 77.3\%.
  Using a dataset of unprecedented size, we developed DBT-DINO, the first foundation model for DBT. DBT-DINO demonstrated strong performance on breast density classification and cancer risk prediction. However, domain-specific pre-training showed variable benefits on the detection task, with ImageNet baseline outperforming DBT-DINO on general lesion detection, indicating that localized detection tasks require further methodological development.

Abstract: We introduce the Do-Undo task and benchmark to address a critical gap in vision-language models: understanding and generating physically plausible scene transformations driven by real-world actions. Unlike prior work focused on object-level edits, Do-Undo requires models to simulate the outcome of a physical action and then accurately reverse it, reflecting true cause-and-effect in the visual world. We curate a large-scale dataset of reversible actions from real-world videos and design a training strategy enforcing consistency for robust action grounding. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with physical reversibility, underscoring the importance of this task for embodied AI, robotics, and physics-aware generative modeling. Do-Undo establishes an intuitive testbed for evaluating and advancing physical reasoning in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is an emerging technology that enables researchers to investigate the molecular relationships underlying tissue morphology. However, acquiring ST data remains prohibitively expensive, and traditional fixed-grid sampling strategies lead to redundant measurements of morphologically similar or biologically uninformative regions, thus resulting in scarce data that constrain current methods. The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios. Code is publicly available at: https://github.com/hrlblab/SCR2ST

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.

Our dataset captures a variety of dynamic scenes, complete with detailed textures, lighting, and motion, making it ideal for training and evaluating cutting-edge 4D scene reconstruction and novel view generation models. In addition to high-fidelity RGB images, we provide multiple complementary modalities, including depth, surface normals, object segmentation and optical flow, enabling a deeper understanding of scene geometry and motion. The dataset is organised into three distinct benchmarking scenarios: a dense multi-view camera setup, a sparse camera arrangement, and monocular video sequences, enabling a wide range of experimentation and comparison across varying levels of data sparsity. With its combination of visual richness, high-quality annotations, and diverse experimental setups, this dataset offers a unique resource for pushing the boundaries of view synthesis and 3D vision.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generation techniques enable AI models to produce highly realistic videos, heightening the need for reliable detection mechanisms. However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is difficult due to the scarcity of normal reference samples and the subtle, localized nature of many defects. Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces.

Abstract: In this paper, we present JoVA, a unified framework for joint video-audio generation. Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation.

Abstract: Recent feed-forward reconstruction models like VGGT and $π^3$ achieve impressive reconstruction quality but cannot process streaming videos due to quadratic memory complexity, limiting their practical deployment. While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

Abstract: Generalization remains the central challenge for interactive 3D scene generation. Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

Abstract: We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quality of the latent space in visual tokenizers (e.g., VAEs) is crucial for modern generative models. However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS. Our pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/VTP.

Abstract: Modern neural architectures for 3D point cloud processing contain both convolutional layers and attention blocks, but the best way to assemble them remains unclear. We analyse the role of different computational blocks in 3D point cloud networks and find an intuitive behaviour: convolution is adequate to extract low-level geometry at high-resolution in early layers, where attention is expensive without bringing any benefits; attention captures high-level semantics and context in low-resolution, deep layers more efficiently. Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE. The resulting LitePT model has $3.6\times$ fewer parameters, runs $2\times$ faster, and uses $2\times$ less memory than the state-of-the-art Point Transformer V3, but nonetheless matches or even outperforms it on a range of tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Crowdsourced street-view imagery from social media provides real-time visual evidence of urban flooding and other crisis events, yet it often lacks reliable geographic metadata for emergency response. Existing image geo-localization approaches, also known as Visual Place Recognition (VPR) models, exhibit substantial performance degradation when applied to such imagery due to visual distortions and domain shifts in cross-source scenarios. This paper presents VPR-AttLLM, a model-agnostic framework that integrates the semantic reasoning and geo-knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) into established VPR pipelines through attention-guided descriptor enhancement. By leveraging LLMs to identify location-informative regions within the city context and suppress visual noise, VPR-AttLLM improves retrieval performance without requiring model retraining or additional data. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on extended benchmarks including SF-XL enriched with real social-media flood images, synthetic flooding scenarios over established query sets and Mapillary photos, and a new HK-URBAN dataset capturing morphologically distinct cityscapes. Integrating VPR-AttLLM with three state-of-the-art VPR models-CosPlace, EigenPlaces, and SALAD-consistently improves recall performance, yielding relative gains typically between 1-3% and reaching up to 8% on the most challenging real flood imagery. Beyond measurable gains in retrieval accuracy, this study establishes a generalizable paradigm for LLM-guided multimodal fusion in visual retrieval systems. By embedding principles from urban perception theory into attention mechanisms, VPR-AttLLM bridges human-like spatial reasoning with modern VPR architectures. Its plug-and-play design, strong cross-source robustness, and interpretability highlight its potential for scalable urban monitoring and rapid geo-localization of crowdsourced crisis imagery.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning typically utilizes the discrete language space for thinking, which is inherently inefficient, as many generated tokens only enforce linguistic rules that are not required for reasoning. To bypass this, latent-space thinking allows models to think using the continuous embedding space. While existing methods for training those models show domain-specific gains, they fail to maintain performance in complex tasks, such as mathematical reasoning. We experimentally demonstrate that the Coconut approach, a form of supervised fine-tuning for latent-space thinking, is highly sensitive to design choices and exhibits several inherent limitations. To address these issues, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) techniques -- an underexplored direction in latent-space thinking -- including GRPO and design a novel Latent RL method for directly optimizing the latent thinking steps. Our experimental results reveal that these RL-trained models still lag behind traditional language-space CoT models in the mathematical reasoning domain. We make our codebase publicly available.

Abstract: Automated document layout analysis remains a major challenge for low-resource, non-Latin scripts. Khmer is a language spoken daily by over 17 million people in Cambodia, receiving little attention in the development of document AI tools. The lack of dedicated resources is particularly acute for business documents, which are critical for both public administration and private enterprise. To address this gap, we present \textbf{KH-FUNSD}, the first publicly available, hierarchically annotated dataset for Khmer form document understanding, including receipts, invoices, and quotations. Our annotation framework features a three-level design: (1) region detection that divides each document into core zones such as header, form field, and footer; (2) FUNSD-style annotation that distinguishes questions, answers, headers, and other key entities, together with their relationships; and (3) fine-grained classification that assigns specific semantic roles, such as field labels, values, headers, footers, and symbols. This multi-level approach supports both comprehensive layout analysis and precise information extraction. We benchmark several leading models, providing the first set of baseline results for Khmer business documents, and discuss the distinct challenges posed by non-Latin, low-resource scripts. The KH-FUNSD dataset and documentation will be available at URL.

Abstract: Producing trustworthy and reliable Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important as their usage becomes more widespread. Calibration seeks to achieve this by improving the alignment between the model's confidence and the actual likelihood of its responses being correct or desirable. However, it has been observed that the internal confidence of a model, derived from token probabilities, is not well aligned with its verbalized confidence, leading to misleading results with different calibration methods. In this paper, we propose Direct Confidence Alignment (DCA), a method using Direct Preference Optimization to align an LLM's verbalized confidence with its internal confidence rather than ground-truth accuracy, enhancing model transparency and reliability by ensuring closer alignment between the two confidence measures. We evaluate DCA across multiple open-weight LLMs on a wide range of datasets. To further assess this alignment, we also introduce three new calibration error-based metrics. Our results show that DCA improves alignment metrics on certain model architectures, reducing inconsistencies in a model's confidence expression. However, we also show that it can be ineffective on others, highlighting the need for more model-aware approaches in the pursuit of more interpretable and trustworthy LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on long-context tasks, but are often bottlenecked by memory constraints. Namely, the KV cache, which is used to significantly speed up attention computations, grows linearly with context length. A suite of compression algorithms has been introduced to alleviate cache growth by evicting unimportant tokens. However, several popular strategies are targeted towards the prefill phase, i.e., processing long prompt context, and their performance is rarely assessed on reasoning tasks requiring long decoding. In particular, short but complex prompts, such as those in benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH500, often benefit from multi-step reasoning and self-reflection, resulting in thinking sequences thousands of tokens long. In this work, we benchmark the performance of several popular compression strategies on long-reasoning tasks. For the non-reasoning Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we determine that no singular strategy fits all, and that performance is heavily influenced by dataset type. However, we discover that H2O and our decoding-enabled variant of SnapKV are dominant strategies for reasoning models, indicating the utility of heavy-hitter tracking for reasoning traces. We also find that eviction strategies at low budgets can produce longer reasoning traces, revealing a tradeoff between cache size and inference costs.

Abstract: In-Car Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA) systems significantly enhance user experience by enabling seamless voice interactions. However, assessing their accuracy and reliability remains a challenge. This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside advanced prompting techniques and agent-based methods to evaluate the extent to which ConvQA system responses adhere to user utterances. The focus lies on contextual understanding and the ability to provide accurate venue recommendations considering user constraints and situational context. To evaluate utterance-response coherence using an LLM, we synthetically generate user utterances accompanied by correct and modified failure-containing system responses. We use input-output, chain-of-thought, self-consistency prompting, and multi-agent prompting techniques with 13 reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs of varying sizes and providers, including OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral AI, and Meta. We evaluate our approach on a case study involving restaurant recommendations. The most substantial improvements occur for small non-reasoning models when applying advanced prompting techniques, particularly multi-agent prompting. However, reasoning models consistently outperform non-reasoning models, with the best performance achieved using single-agent prompting with self-consistency. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 reaches an F1-score of 0.99 at a cost of 0.002 USD per request. Overall, the best balance between effectiveness and cost-time efficiency is reached with the non-reasoning model DeepSeek-V3. Our findings show that LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable and accurate alternative to traditional human evaluation for benchmarking contextual understanding in ConvQA systems.

Furthermore, our approach is training-free, applicable to closed-source models, and scalable. In addition to providing theoretical justification for the working of our method, we also demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that Voyager significantly outperforms popular baseline approaches by providing a 1.5-3x improvement in diversity.

Abstract: The growing demand for long-context inference capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified the computational and memory bottlenecks inherent to the standard attention mechanism. To address this challenge, we introduce BLASST, a drop-in sparse attention method that dynamically prunes the attention matrix without any pre-computation or proxy scores. Our method uses a fixed threshold and existing information from online softmax to identify negligible attention scores, skipping softmax computation, Value block loading, and the subsequent matrix multiplication. This fits seamlessly into existing FlashAttention kernel designs with negligible latency overhead. The approach is applicable to both prefill and decode stages across all attention variants (MHA, GQA, MQA, and MLA), providing a unified solution for accelerating long-context inference. We develop an automated calibration procedure that reveals a simple inverse relationship between optimal threshold and context length, enabling robust deployment across diverse scenarios. Maintaining high accuracy, we demonstrate a 1.62x speedup for prefill at 74.7% sparsity and a 1.48x speedup for decode at 73.2% sparsity on modern GPUs. Furthermore, we explore sparsity-aware training as a natural extension, showing that models can be trained to be inherently more robust to sparse attention patterns, pushing the accuracy-sparsity frontier even further.

Abstract: So far, expensive finetuning beyond the pretraining sequence length has been a requirement for effectively extending the context of language models (LM). In this work, we break this key bottleneck by Dropping the Positional Embeddings of LMs after training (DroPE). Our simple method is motivated by three key theoretical and empirical observations. First, positional embeddings (PEs) serve a crucial role during pretraining, providing an important inductive bias that significantly facilitates convergence. Second, over-reliance on this explicit positional information is also precisely what prevents test-time generalization to sequences of unseen length, even when using popular PE-scaling methods. Third, positional embeddings are not an inherent requirement of effective language modeling and can be safely removed after pretraining, following a short recalibration phase. Empirically, DroPE yields seamless zero-shot context extension without any long-context finetuning, quickly adapting pretrained LMs without compromising their capabilities in the original training context. Our findings hold across different models and dataset sizes, far outperforming previous specialized architectures and established rotary positional embedding scaling methods.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel generation and improved global coherence. During inference, DLMs generate text by iteratively denoising masked sequences in parallel; however, determining which positions to unmask and which tokens to commit forms a large combinatorial search problem. Existing inference methods approximate this search using heuristics, which often yield suboptimal decoding paths; other approaches instead rely on additional training to guide token selection. To introduce a principled search mechanism for DLMs inference, we introduce MEDAL, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree SEarch initialization for Diffusion LAnguage Model inference. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search at the initialization stage to explore promising unmasking trajectories, providing a robust starting point for subsequent refinement. This integration is enabled by restricting the search space to high-confidence actions and prioritizing token choices that improve model confidence over remaining masked positions. Across multiple benchmarks, MEDAL achieves up to 22.0% improvement over existing inference strategies, establishing a new paradigm for search-based inference in diffusion language models.

Abstract: Semantic distance measurement is a fundamental problem in computational linguistics, providing a quantitative characterization of similarity or relatedness between text segments, and underpinning tasks such as text retrieval and text classification. From a mathematical perspective, a semantic distance can be viewed as a metric defined on a space of texts or on a representation space derived from them. However, most classical semantic distance methods are essentially fixed, making them difficult to adapt to specific data distributions and task requirements. In this paper, a semantic distance measure based on multi-kernel Gaussian processes (MK-GP) was proposed. The latent semantic function associated with texts was modeled as a Gaussian process, with its covariance function given by a combined kernel combining Matérn and polynomial components. The kernel parameters were learned automatically from data under supervision, rather than being hand-crafted. This semantic distance was instantiated and evaluated in the context of fine-grained sentiment classification with large language models under an in-context learning (ICL) setup. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed measure.

Abstract: The phenomenon of sound symbolism, the non-arbitrary mapping between word sounds and meanings, has long been demonstrated through anecdotal experiments like Bouba Kiki, but rarely tested at scale. We present the first computational cross-linguistic analysis of sound symbolism in the semantic domain of size. We compile a typologically broad dataset of 810 adjectives (27 languages, 30 words each), each phonemically transcribed and validated with native-speaker audio. Using interpretable classifiers over bag-of-segment features, we find that phonological form predicts size semantics above chance even across unrelated languages, with both vowels and consonants contributing. To probe universality beyond genealogy, we train an adversarial scrubber that suppresses language identity while preserving size signal (also at family granularity). Language prediction averaged across languages and settings falls below chance while size prediction remains significantly above chance, indicating cross-family sound-symbolic bias. We release data, code, and diagnostic tools for future large-scale studies of iconicity.

Abstract: We introduce MARKET-BENCH, a benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on introductory quantitative trading tasks by asking them to construct executable backtesters from natural-language strategy descriptions and market assumptions. Each instance specifies one of three canonical strategies -- scheduled trading on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), pairs trading on Coca-Cola (NASDAQ: KO) and Pepsi (NASDAQ: PEP), or delta hedging on MSFT -- and models must produce code whose P\&L, drawdown, and position paths match a verifiable reference implementation. We assess twelve state-of-the-art models using a multi-round pass@k metric that separates structural reliability (whether the backtest runs) from numerical accuracy (mean absolute error of the backtest metrics). While most models reliably execute the simplest strategy (average pass@3 of 0.80), errors vary by orders of magnitude across models and tasks: Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 4.5 Sonnet combine strong reliability with low error on simpler strategies, GPT-5.1 Codex-Max achieves perfect pass@1 on the first two strategies and the lowest best-run error on the easiest task, and Qwen3 Max attains perfect pass@3 yet sometimes produces inaccurate P\&L paths. These results show that current LLMs can scaffold basic trading infrastructure but still struggle to reason robustly about prices, inventory, and risk; we release MARKET-BENCH and a public leaderboard at https://marketbench.ai.

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight input-level adapter for the F5-TTS model that enables Romanian Language support. To preserve the existing capabilities of the model (voice cloning, English and Chinese support), we keep the original weights frozen, append a sub-network to the model and train it as an extension for the textual embedding matrix of the text encoder. For simplicity, we rely on ConvNeXt module implemented in F5-TTS to also model the co-dependencies between the new character-level embeddings. The module serves as a ``soft`` letter-to-sound layer, converting Romanian text into a continuous representation that the F5-TTS model uses to produce naturally sounding Romanian utterances. We evaluate the model with a pool of 20 human listeners across three tasks: (a) audio similarity between reference and generated speech, (b) pronunciation and naturalness and (c) Romanian-English code-switching. The results indicate that our approach maintains voice cloning capabilities and enables, to a certain extent, code-switching within the same utterance; however, residual English accent characteristics remain. We open-source our code and provide example audio samples at https://github.com/racai-ro/Ro-F5TTS.

Abstract: Although Large language Model (LLM)-powered information extraction (IE) systems have shown impressive capabilities, current fine-tuning paradigms face two major limitations: high training costs and difficulties in aligning with LLM preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel universal IE paradigm, the Self-Correcting Iterative Refinement (SCIR) framework, along with a Multi-task Bilingual (Chinese-English) Self-Correcting (MBSC) dataset containing over 100,000 entries. The SCIR framework achieves plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs and IE systems through its Dual-Path Self-Correcting module and feedback-driven optimization, thereby significantly reducing training costs. Concurrently, the MBSC dataset tackles the challenge of preference alignment by indirectly distilling GPT-4's capabilities into IE result detection models. Experimental results demonstrate that SCIR outperforms state-of-the-art IE methods across three key tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction, achieving a 5.27 percent average improvement in span-based Micro-F1 while reducing training costs by 87 percent compared to baseline approaches. These advancements not only enhance the flexibility and accuracy of IE systems but also pave the way for lightweight and efficient IE paradigms.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in scientific research, the issue of their trustworthiness becomes crucial. In psycholinguistics, LLMs have been recently employed in automatically augmenting human-rated datasets, with promising results obtained by generating ratings for single words. Yet, performance for ratings of complex items, i.e., metaphors, is still unexplored. Here, we present the first assessment of the validity and reliability of ratings of metaphors on familiarity, comprehensibility, and imageability, generated by three GPT models for a total of 687 items gathered from the Italian Figurative Archive and three English studies. We performed a thorough validation in terms of both alignment with human data and ability to predict behavioral and electrophysiological responses. We found that machine-generated ratings positively correlated with human-generated ones. Familiarity ratings reached moderate-to-strong correlations for both English and Italian metaphors, although correlations weakened for metaphors with high sensorimotor load. Imageability showed moderate correlations in English and moderate-to-strong in Italian. Comprehensibility for English metaphors exhibited the strongest correlations. Overall, larger models outperformed smaller ones and greater human-model misalignment emerged with familiarity and imageability. Machine-generated ratings significantly predicted response times and the EEG amplitude, with a strength comparable to human ratings. Moreover, GPT ratings obtained across independent sessions were highly stable. We conclude that GPT, especially larger models, can validly and reliably replace - or augment - human subjects in rating metaphor properties. Yet, LLMs align worse with humans when dealing with conventionality and multimodal aspects of metaphorical meaning, calling for careful consideration of the nature of stimuli.

Abstract: Culture is the bedrock of human interaction; it dictates how we perceive and respond to everyday interactions. As the field of human-computer interaction grows via the rise of generative Large Language Models (LLMs), the cultural alignment of these models become an important field of study. This work, using the VSM13 International Survey and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, identifies the cultural alignment of popular LLMs (DeepSeek-V3, V3.1, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4, Claude Opus 4, Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large). We then use cultural prompting, or using system prompts to shift the cultural alignment of a model to a desired country, to test the adaptability of these models to other cultures, namely China, France, India, Iran, Japan, and the United States. We find that the majority of the eight LLMs tested favor the United States when the culture is not specified, with varying results when prompted for other cultures. When using cultural prompting, seven of the eight models shifted closer to the expected culture. We find that models had trouble aligning with Japan and China, despite two of the models tested originating with the Chinese company DeepSeek.

Abstract: The vast majority of the world's languages, particularly creoles like Nagamese, remain severely under-resourced in Natural Language Processing (NLP), creating a significant barrier to their representation in digital technology. This paper introduces NagaNLP, a comprehensive open-source toolkit for Nagamese, bootstrapped through a novel methodology that relies on LLM-driven but human-validated synthetic data generation. We detail a multi-stage pipeline where an expert-guided LLM (Gemini) generates a candidate corpus, which is then refined and annotated by native speakers. This synthetic-hybrid approach yielded a 10K pair conversational dataset and a high-quality annotated corpus for foundational tasks. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we trained both discriminative and generative models. Our fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-base model establishes a new benchmark for Nagamese, achieving a 93.81\% accuracy (0.90 F1-Macro) on Part-of-Speech tagging and a 0.75 F1-Macro on Named Entity Recognition, massively outperforming strong zero-shot baselines. Furthermore, we fine-tuned a Llama-3.2-3B Instruct model, named NagaLLaMA, which demonstrates superior performance on conversational tasks, achieving a Perplexity of 3.85, an order of magnitude improvement over its few-shot counterpart (96.76). We release the NagaNLP toolkit, including all datasets, models, and code, providing a foundational resource for a previously underserved language and a reproducible framework for reducing data scarcity in other low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Instruction-based text editing is increasingly critical for real-world applications such as code editors (e.g., Cursor), but Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to struggle with this task. Unlike free-form generation, editing requires faithfully implementing user instructions while preserving unchanged content, as even minor unintended modifications can break functionality. Existing approaches treat editing as generic text generation, leading to two key failures: they struggle to faithfully align edits with diverse user intents, and they often over-edit unchanged regions. We propose HyperEdit to address both issues. First, we introduce hypernetwork-based dynamic adaptation that generates request-specific parameters, enabling the model to tailor its editing strategy to each instruction. Second, we develop difference-aware regularization that focuses supervision on modified spans, preventing over-editing while ensuring precise, minimal changes. HyperEdit achieves a 9%--30% relative improvement in BLEU on modified regions over state-of-the-art baselines, despite utilizing only 3B parameters.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning have achieved impressive progress in language model reasoning, they are constrained by the requirement for verifiable rewards. Recent verifier-free RL methods address this limitation by utilizing the intrinsic probabilities of LLMs generating reference answers as reward signals. However, these approaches typically sample reasoning traces conditioned only on the question. This design decouples reasoning-trace sampling from answer information, leading to inefficient exploration and incoherence between traces and final answers. In this paper, we propose \textit{\b{Co}upled \b{V}ariational \b{R}einforcement \b{L}earning} (CoVRL), which bridges variational inference and reinforcement learning by coupling prior and posterior distributions through a hybrid sampling strategy. By constructing and optimizing a composite distribution that integrates these two distributions, CoVRL enables efficient exploration while preserving strong thought-answer coherence. Extensive experiments on mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that CoVRL improves performance by 12.4\% over the base model and achieves an additional 2.3\% improvement over strong state-of-the-art verifier-free RL baselines, providing a principled framework for enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at extracting common patterns from large-scale corpora, yet they struggle with rare, low-resource, or previously unseen scenarios-such as niche hardware deployment issues or irregular IoT device behaviors-because such cases are sparsely represented in training data. Moreover, LLMs rely primarily on implicit parametric memory, which limits their ability to explicitly acquire, recall, and refine methods, causing them to behave predominantly as intuition-driven predictors rather than deliberate, method-oriented learners. Inspired by how humans learn from rare experiences, this paper proposes a human-inspired learning framework that integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Obvious Record, explicitly stores cause--result (or question--solution) relationships as symbolic memory, enabling persistent learning even from single or infrequent encounters. The second, Maximum-Entropy Method Discovery, prioritizes and preserves methods with high semantic dissimilarity, allowing the system to capture diverse and underrepresented strategies that are typically overlooked by next-token prediction. Verification on a benchmark of 60 semantically diverse question--solution pairs demonstrates that the proposed entropy-guided approach achieves stronger coverage of unseen questions and significantly greater internal diversity than a random baseline, confirming its effectiveness in discovering more generalizable and human-inspired methods.

Abstract: Sparse Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are commonly encountered in real-world applications, where knowledge is often incomplete or limited. Sparse KG reasoning, the task of inferring missing knowledge over sparse KGs, is inherently challenging due to the scarcity of knowledge and the difficulty of capturing relational patterns in sparse scenarios. Among all sparse KG reasoning methods, path-based ones have attracted plenty of attention due to their interpretability. Existing path-based methods typically rely on computationally intensive random walks to collect paths, producing paths of variable quality. Additionally, these methods fail to leverage the structured nature of graphs by treating paths independently. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Structural and Probabilistic framework named StruProKGR, tailored for efficient and interpretable reasoning on sparse KGs. StruProKGR utilizes a distance-guided path collection mechanism to significantly reduce computational costs while exploring more relevant paths. It further enhances the reasoning process by incorporating structural information through probabilistic path aggregation, which prioritizes paths that reinforce each other. Extensive experiments on five sparse KG reasoning benchmarks reveal that StruProKGR surpasses existing path-based methods in both effectiveness and efficiency, providing an effective, efficient, and interpretable solution for sparse KG reasoning.

To aid in our studies, we use 14 large language models and investigate their syllogistic reasoning capabilities in terms of symbolic inferences as well as natural language understanding. Even though this reasoning mechanism is not a uniform emergent property across LLMs, the perfect symbolic performances in certain models make us wonder whether LLMs are becoming more and more formal reasoning mechanisms, rather than making explicit the nuances of human reasoning.

Abstract: Legal relations form a highly consequential analytical framework of civil law system, serving as a crucial foundation for resolving disputes and realizing values of the rule of law in judicial practice. However, legal relations in Chinese civil cases remain underexplored in the field of legal artificial intelligence (legal AI), largely due to the absence of comprehensive schemas. In this work, we firstly introduce a comprehensive schema, which contains a hierarchical taxonomy and definitions of arguments, for AI systems to capture legal relations in Chinese civil cases. Based on this schema, we then formulate legal relation extraction task and present LexRel, an expert-annotated benchmark for legal relation extraction in Chinese civil law. We use LexRel to evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on legal relation extractions, showing that current LLMs exhibit significant limitations in accurately identifying civil legal relations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating legal relations information leads to consistent performance gains on other downstream legal AI tasks.

Abstract: Authorship analysis has traditionally focused on lexical and stylistic cues within text, while higher-level narrative structure remains underexplored, particularly for low-resource languages such as Urdu. This work proposes a graph-based framework that models Urdu novels as character interaction networks to examine whether authorial style can be inferred from narrative structure alone. Each novel is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to characters and edges denote their co-occurrence within narrative proximity. We systematically compare multiple graph representations, including global structural features, node-level semantic summaries, unsupervised graph embeddings, and supervised graph neural networks. Experiments on a dataset of 52 Urdu novels written by seven authors show that learned graph representations substantially outperform hand-crafted and unsupervised baselines, achieving up to 0.857 accuracy under a strict author-aware evaluation protocol.

Abstract: We explore efficient strategies to fine-tune decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream text classification under resource constraints. Two approaches are investigated: (1) attaching a classification head to a pre-trained causal LLM and fine-tuning on the task (using the LLM's final token embedding as a sequence representation), and (2) instruction-tuning the LLM in a prompt->response format for classification. To enable single-GPU fine-tuning of models up to 8B parameters, we combine 4-bit model quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient training. Experiments on two datasets - a proprietary single-label dataset and the public WIPO-Alpha patent dataset (extreme multi-label classification) - show that the embedding-based method significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned method in F1-score, and is very competitive with - even surpassing - fine-tuned domain-specific models (e.g. BERT) on the same tasks. These results demonstrate that directly leveraging the internal representations of causal LLMs, along with efficient fine-tuning techniques, yields impressive classification performance under limited computational resources. We discuss the advantages of each approach while outlining practical guidelines and future directions for optimizing LLM fine-tuning in classification scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents trained with reinforcement learning (RL) show great promise for solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, their performance is often crippled by "Context Explosion", where the accumulation of long text outputs overwhelms the model's context window and leads to reasoning failures. To address this, we introduce CoDA, a Context-Decoupled hierarchical Agent, a simple but effective reinforcement learning framework that decouples high-level planning from low-level execution. It employs a single, shared LLM backbone that learns to operate in two distinct, contextually isolated roles: a high-level Planner that decomposes tasks within a concise strategic context, and a low-level Executor that handles tool interactions in an ephemeral, isolated workspace. We train this unified agent end-to-end using PECO (Planner-Executor Co-Optimization), a reinforcement learning methodology that applies a trajectory-level reward to jointly optimize both roles, fostering seamless collaboration through context-dependent policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, and it exhibits strong robustness in long-context scenarios, maintaining stable performance while all other baselines suffer severe degradation, thus further validating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design in mitigating context overload.

Abstract: Recent advances in coding agents suggest rapid progress toward autonomous software development, yet existing benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon capabilities required to build complete software systems. Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.

Abstract: Continued pretraining extends a language model's capabilities by further exposing it to additional data, often tailored to a specific linguistic or domain context. This strategy has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining when adapting general-purpose models to new settings. In this work, we investigate this paradigm through Curió 7B, a 7-billion-parameter model derived from LLaMA-2 and trained on 100 billion Portuguese tokens from the ClassiCC-PT corpus - the most extensive Portuguese-specific continued-pretraining effort above the three-billion-parameter scale to date. Beyond scale, we investigate whether quantity alone suffices or whether data quality plays a decisive role in linguistic adaptation. To this end, we introduce Curió-Edu 7B, a variant trained exclusively on the educational and STEM-filtered subset of the same corpus, totaling just 10 billion tokens. Despite using only 10% of the data and 20% of the computation, Curió-Edu 7B surpasses the full-corpus model in our evaluations, demonstrating that data selection can be fundamental even when adapting models with limited prior exposure to the target language. The developed models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/ClassiCC-Corpus/curio-edu

Abstract: Persona-assigned large language models (LLMs) are used in domains such as education, healthcare, and sociodemographic simulation. Yet, they are typically evaluated only in short, single-round settings that do not reflect real-world usage. We introduce an evaluation protocol that combines long persona dialogues (over 100 rounds) and evaluation datasets to create dialogue-conditioned benchmarks that can robustly measure long-context effects. We then investigate the effects of dialogue length on persona fidelity, instruction-following, and safety of seven state-of-the-art open- and closed-weight LLMs. We find that persona fidelity degrades over the course of dialogues, especially in goal-oriented conversations, where models must sustain both persona fidelity and instruction following. We identify a trade-off between fidelity and instruction following, with non-persona baselines initially outperforming persona-assigned models; as dialogues progress and fidelity fades, persona responses become increasingly similar to baseline responses. Our findings highlight the fragility of persona applications in extended interactions and our work provides a protocol to systematically measure such failures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate reasoning tokens before their final answer to boost performance on complex tasks. While these sequences seem like human thought processes, empirical evidence reveals that they are not a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning process. To address this gap between appearance and function, we introduce the State over Tokens (SoT) conceptual framework. SoT reframes reasoning tokens not as a linguistic narrative, but as an externalized computational state -- the sole persistent information carrier across the model's stateless generation cycles. This explains how the tokens can drive correct reasoning without being a faithful explanation when read as text and surfaces previously overlooked research questions on these tokens. We argue that to truly understand the process that LLMs do, research must move beyond reading the reasoning tokens as text and focus on decoding them as state.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical factor influencing large language model (LLM) performance, yet the impact of pragmatic elements such as linguistic tone and politeness remains underexplored, particularly across different model families. In this work, we propose a systematic evaluation framework to examine how interaction tone affects model accuracy and apply it to three recently released and widely available LLMs: GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Google DeepMind), and Llama 4 Scout (Meta). Using the MMMLU benchmark, we evaluate model performance under Very Friendly, Neutral, and Very Rude prompt variants across six tasks spanning STEM and Humanities domains, and analyze pairwise accuracy differences with statistical significance testing.
  Our results show that tone sensitivity is both model-dependent and domain-specific. Neutral or Very Friendly prompts generally yield higher accuracy than Very Rude prompts, but statistically significant effects appear only in a subset of Humanities tasks, where rude tone reduces accuracy for GPT and Llama, while Gemini remains comparatively tone-insensitive. When performance is aggregated across tasks within each domain, tone effects diminish and largely lose statistical significance. Compared with earlier researches, these findings suggest that dataset scale and coverage materially influence the detection of tone effects. Overall, our study indicates that while interaction tone can matter in specific interpretive settings, modern LLMs are broadly robust to tonal variation in typical mixed-domain use, providing practical guidance for prompt design and model selection in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Agent memory has been touted as a dimension of growth for LLM-based applications, enabling agents that can accumulate experience, adapt across sessions, and move beyond single-shot question answering. The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.

Abstract: In this work, we conduct systematic research in a challenging area: the automatic evaluation of book-length stories (>100K tokens). Our study focuses on two key questions: (1) understanding which evaluation aspects matter most to readers, and (2) exploring effective methods for evaluating lengthy stories. We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, LongStoryEval, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an evaluation criteria structure and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: aggregation-based, incremental-updated, and summary-based evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose NovelCritique, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects. NovelCritique outperforms commercial models like GPT-4o in aligning with human evaluations. Our datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/DingyiYang/LongStoryEval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on multiple-choice clinical diagnosis benchmarks, yet it is unclear how much of this performance reflects underlying probabilistic reasoning. We study this through questions from MedQA, where the task is to select the most likely diagnosis. We introduce the Frequency-Based Probabilistic Ranker (FBPR), a lightweight method that scores options with a smoothed Naive Bayes over concept-diagnosis co-occurrence statistics from a large corpus. When co-occurrence statistics were sourced from the pretraining corpora for OLMo and Llama, FBPR achieves comparable performance to the corresponding LLMs pretrained on that same corpus. Direct LLM inference and FBPR largely get different questions correct, with an overlap only slightly above random chance, indicating complementary strengths of each method. These findings highlight the continued value of explicit probabilistic baselines: they provide a meaningful performance reference point and a complementary signal for potential hybridization. While the performance of LLMs seems to be driven by a mechanism other than simple frequency aggregation, we show that an approach similar to the historically grounded, low-complexity expert systems still accounts for a substantial portion of benchmark performance.

Abstract: Accurately mapping legal terminology across languages remains a significant challenge, especially for language pairs like Chinese and Japanese, which share a large number of homographs with different meanings. Existing resources and standardized tools for these languages are limited. To address this, we propose a human-AI collaborative approach for building a multilingual legal terminology database, based on a multi-agent framework. This approach integrates advanced large language models and legal domain experts throughout the entire process-from raw document preprocessing, article-level alignment, to terminology extraction, mapping, and quality assurance. Unlike a single automated pipeline, our approach places greater emphasis on how human experts participate in this multi-agent system. Humans and AI agents take on different roles: AI agents handle specific, repetitive tasks, such as OCR, text segmentation, semantic alignment, and initial terminology extraction, while human experts provide crucial oversight, review, and supervise the outputs with contextual knowledge and legal judgment. We tested the effectiveness of this framework using a trilingual parallel corpus comprising 35 key Chinese statutes, along with their English and Japanese translations. The experimental results show that this human-in-the-loop, multi-agent workflow not only improves the precision and consistency of multilingual legal terminology mapping but also offers greater scalability compared to traditional manual methods.

Abstract: We introduce QwenLong-L1.5, a model that achieves superior long-context reasoning capabilities through systematic post-training innovations. The key technical breakthroughs of QwenLong-L1.5 are as follows: (1) Long-Context Data Synthesis Pipeline: We develop a systematic synthesis framework that generates challenging reasoning tasks requiring multi-hop grounding over globally distributed evidence. By deconstructing documents into atomic facts and their underlying relationships, and then programmatically composing verifiable reasoning questions, our approach creates high-quality training data at scale, moving substantially beyond simple retrieval tasks to enable genuine long-range reasoning capabilities. (2) Stabilized Reinforcement Learning for Long-Context Training: To overcome the critical instability in long-context RL, we introduce task-balanced sampling with task-specific advantage estimation to mitigate reward bias, and propose Adaptive Entropy-Controlled Policy Optimization (AEPO) that dynamically regulates exploration-exploitation trade-offs. (3) Memory-Augmented Architecture for Ultra-Long Contexts: Recognizing that even extended context windows cannot accommodate arbitrarily long sequences, we develop a memory management framework with multi-stage fusion RL training that seamlessly integrates single-pass reasoning with iterative memory-based processing for tasks exceeding 4M tokens. Based on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, QwenLong-L1.5 achieves performance comparable to GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on long-context reasoning benchmarks, surpassing its baseline by 9.90 points on average. On ultra-long tasks (1M~4M tokens), QwenLong-L1.5's memory-agent framework yields a 9.48-point gain over the agent baseline. Additionally, the acquired long-context reasoning ability translates to enhanced performance in general domains like scientific reasoning, memory tool using, and extended dialogue.

Abstract: The status quo for labeling text is third-party annotation, but there are many cases where information directly from the document's source would be preferable over a third-person proxy, especially for egocentric features like sentiment and belief. We introduce author labeling, an annotation technique where the writer of the document itself annotates the data at the moment of creation. We collaborate with a commercial chatbot with over 10,000 users to deploy an author labeling annotation system for subjective features related to product recommendation. This system identifies task-relevant queries, generates on-the-fly labeling questions, and records authors' answers in real time. We train and deploy an online-learning model architecture for product recommendation that continuously improves from author labeling and find it achieved a 534% increase in click-through rate compared to an industry advertising baseline running concurrently. We then compare the quality and practicality of author labeling to three traditional annotation approaches for sentiment analysis and find author labeling to be higher quality, faster to acquire, and cheaper. These findings reinforce existing literature that annotations, especially for egocentric and subjective beliefs, are significantly higher quality when labeled by the author rather than a third party. To facilitate broader scientific adoption, we release an author labeling service for the research community at academic.echollm.io.

The system combines an open-source large language model (LLM) with an open web search API to perform iterative retrieval, reasoning, and synthesis in real-world open-domain settings. To enhance reasoning quality, we apply preference tuning based on LLM-as-a-judge feedback that evaluates multiple aspects, including clarity, insightfulness, and factuality. Our experimental results show that the proposed method consistently improves answer quality across all three aspects.

Abstract: Bilateral negotiation is a complex, context-sensitive task in which human negotiators dynamically adjust anchors, pacing, and flexibility to exploit power asymmetries and informal cues. We introduce a unified mathematical framework for modeling concession dynamics based on a hyperbolic tangent curve, and propose two metrics burstiness tau and the Concession-Rigidity Index (CRI) to quantify the timing and rigidity of offer trajectories. We conduct a large-scale empirical comparison between human negotiators and four state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) across natural-language and numeric-offers settings, with and without rich market context, as well as six controlled power-asymmetry scenarios. Our results reveal that, unlike humans who smoothly adapt to situations and infer the opponents position and strategies, LLMs systematically anchor at extremes of the possible agreement zone for negotiations and optimize for fixed points irrespective of leverage or context. Qualitative analysis further shows limited strategy diversity and occasional deceptive tactics used by LLMs. Moreover the ability of LLMs to negotiate does not improve with better models. These findings highlight fundamental limitations in current LLM negotiation capabilities and point to the need for models that better internalize opponent reasoning and context-dependent strategy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, they often struggle with long-text sequences due to the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon. This issue has been shown to arise from a U-shaped attention bias, where attention is disproportionately focused on the beginning and end of a text, leaving the middle section underrepresented. While previous studies have attributed this bias to position encoding, our research first identifies an additional factor: initial saliency. It means that in the attention computation for each token, tokens with higher attention weights relative to the initial token tend to receive more attention in the prediction of the next token. We further find that utilizing this property by scaling attention weight between the initial token and others improves the model's ability to process long contexts, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.6\% in MDQA dataset. Moreover, combining this approach with existing methods to reduce position encoding bias further enhances performance, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.4\% in KV-Retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative Decoding is a prominent technique for accelerating the autoregressive inference of large language models (LLMs) by employing a fast draft model to propose candidate token sequences and a large target model to verify them in parallel. However, its core component -- the rejection sampling mechanism -- relies on a fixed, context-independent random threshold. This leads to a significant "random rejection" problem in high-uncertainty generation scenarios, where plausible candidate tokens are frequently rejected due to random chance, undermining inference efficiency. This paper introduces Efficient Adaptive Rejection Sampling (EARS), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the acceptance threshold by incorporating the target model's own predictive uncertainty, measured as \(1 - \max(P_{\mathrm{target}})\). By introducing a tolerance term proportional to this uncertainty, EARS intelligently relaxes the acceptance criterion when the model is uncertain, effectively reducing random rejections while maintaining strict standards when the model is confident. Experiments on creative writing and open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that EARS significantly enhances the efficiency of speculative decoding, achieving up to an 18.12% increase in throughput with a negligible 0.84% accuracy drop on the GSM8K benchmark. The method requires no modifications to model architectures and can be seamlessly integrated into existing speculative decoding frameworks.

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning has advanced large language models (LLMs) to reason through long chain-of-thought trajectories while interleaving external tool use. Existing approaches assume a fixed inventory of tools, limiting LLM agents' adaptability to new or evolving toolsets. We present AutoTool, a framework that equips LLM agents with dynamic tool-selection capabilities throughout their reasoning trajectories. We first construct a 200k dataset with explicit tool-selection rationales across 1,000+ tools and 100+ tasks spanning mathematics, science, code generation, and multimodal reasoning. Building on this data foundation, AutoTool employs a dual-phase optimization pipeline: (i) supervised and RL-based trajectory stabilization for coherent reasoning, and (ii) KL-regularized Plackett-Luce ranking to refine consistent multi-step tool selection. Across ten diverse benchmarks, we train two base models, Qwen3-8B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, with AutoTool. With fewer parameters, AutoTool consistently outperforms advanced LLM agents and tool-integration methods, yielding average gains of 6.4% in math & science reasoning, 4.5% in search-based QA, 7.7% in code generation, and 6.9% in multimodal understanding. In addition, AutoTool exhibits stronger generalization by dynamically leveraging unseen tools from evolving toolsets during inference.

Abstract: LLMs achieve remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, yet effectively transferring these skills via post-training distillation remains challenging. Existing data selection methods, ranging from manual curation to heuristics based on length, entropy, or overall loss, fail to capture the causal importance of individual reasoning steps, limiting distillation efficiency. To address this, we propose Attention Influence for Reasoning (AIR), a principled, unsupervised and training-free framework that leverages mechanistic insights of the retrieval head to select high-value post-training data. AIR first identifies reasoning-critical attention heads of an off-the-shelf model, then constructs a weakened reference model with disabled head influence, and finally quantifies the resulting loss divergence as the Attention Influence Score. This score enables fine-grained assessment at both the step and sample levels, supporting step-level weighted fine-tuning and global sample selection. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that AIR consistently improves reasoning accuracy, surpassing heuristic baselines and effectively isolating the most critical steps and samples. Our work establishes a mechanism-driven, data-efficient approach for reasoning distillation in LLMs.

Abstract: In fact-checking applications, a common reason to reject a claim is to detect the presence of erroneous cause-effect relationships between the events at play. However, current automated fact-checking methods lack dedicated causal-based reasoning, potentially missing a valuable opportunity for semantically rich explainability. To address this gap, we propose a methodology that combines event relation extraction, semantic similarity computation, and rule-based reasoning to detect logical inconsistencies between chains of events mentioned in a claim and in an evidence. Evaluated on two fact-checking datasets, this method establishes the first baseline for integrating fine-grained causal event relationships into fact-checking and enhance explainability of verdict prediction.

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but often limited by high computational cost, privacy concerns, and English-centric training. Recent progress demonstrates that small, efficient models with around one billion parameters can deliver strong results and enable on-device use. This paper introduces MiniLingua, a multilingual open-source LLM of one billion parameters trained from scratch for 13 European languages, designed to balance coverage and instruction-following capabilities. Based on evaluation results, the instruction-tuned version of MiniLingua outperforms EuroLLM, a model with a similar training approach but a larger training budget, on summarization, classification and both open- and closed-book question answering. Moreover, it remains competitive with more advanced state-of-the-art models on open-ended generation tasks. We release model weights, tokenizer and source code used for data processing and model training.

Abstract: We introduce FIN-bench-v2, a unified benchmark suite for evaluating large language models in Finnish. FIN-bench-v2 consolidates Finnish versions of widely used benchmarks together with an updated and expanded version of the original FIN-bench into a single, consistently formatted collection, covering multiple-choice and generative tasks across reading comprehension, commonsense reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, and alignment. All datasets are converted to HuggingFace Datasets, which include both cloze and multiple-choice prompt formulations with five variants per task, and we incorporate human annotation or review for machine-translated resources such as GoldenSwag and XED. To select robust tasks, we pretrain a set of 2.15B-parameter decoder-only models and use their learning curves to compute monotonicity, signal-to-noise, non-random performance, and model ordering consistency, retaining only tasks that satisfy all criteria. We further evaluate a set of larger instruction-tuned models to characterize performance across tasks and prompt formulations. All datasets, prompts, and evaluation configurations are publicly available via our fork of the Language Model Evaluation Harness at https://github.com/LumiOpen/lm-evaluation-harness. Supplementary resources are released in a separate repository at https://github.com/TurkuNLP/FIN-bench-v2.

Abstract: Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Premature semantic collapse -- the forced early commitment to a single meaning -- remains a core architectural limitation of current language models. Softmax-driven competition and greedy decoding cause models to discard valid interpretations before sufficient context is available, resulting in brittle reasoning and context failures. We introduce Non-Resolution Reasoning (NRR), a general computational framework that preserves semantic ambiguity during inference and performs resolution only when explicitly required. NRR integrates three components: (1) Multi-Vector Embeddings that maintain multiple viable interpretations per token, (2) Non-Collapsing Attention that prevents winner-take-all dynamics across layers, and (3) Contextual Identity Tracking (CIT), which assigns context-specific identities to recurring entities (e.g., distinguishing "Dr. Smith the cardiologist" from "Dr. Smith the researcher"). These mechanisms are unified by an external Resolution Operator $ρ$ that makes semantic commitment explicit, controllable, and task-dependent. Unlike standard architectures, NRR separates representation from resolution, allowing a single model to shift between creative, factual, and ambiguity-preserving reasoning without retraining. A synthetic evaluation demonstrates NRR's ability to preserve ambiguity and track context: CIT-enhanced models achieve 90.9% accuracy on out-of-distribution identity-shift tasks, compared to 9.1% for transformer baselines. NRR provides a principled alternative to premature collapse, reframing ambiguity as an explicit representational state rather than a failure mode. The question is not whether AI should resolve ambiguity, but when, how, and under whose control.

Abstract: Bangla is the sixth most widely spoken language globally, with approximately 234 million native speakers. However, progress in open-source Bangla machine translation remains limited. Most online resources are in English and often remain untranslated into Bangla, excluding millions from accessing essential information. Existing research in Bangla translation primarily focuses on formal language, neglecting the more commonly used informal language. This is largely due to the lack of pairwise Bangla-English data and advanced translation models. If datasets and models can be enhanced to better handle natural, informal Bangla, millions of people will benefit from improved online information access. In this research, we explore current state-of-the-art models and propose improvements to Bangla translation by developing a dataset from informal sources like social media and conversational texts. This work aims to advance Bangla machine translation by focusing on informal language translation and improving accessibility for Bangla speakers in the digital world.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes pose significant challenges for deployment on edge devices with limited computational and memory resources. Low-rank compression is a promising approach to address this issue, as it reduces both computational and memory costs, making LLM more suitable for resource-constrained environments. Nonetheless, naïve low-rank compression methods require a significant reduction in the retained rank to achieve meaningful memory and computation savings. For a low-rank model, the ranks need to be reduced by more than half to yield efficiency gains. Such aggressive truncation, however, typically results in substantial performance degradation. To address this trade-off, we propose SkipCat, a novel low-rank compression framework that enables the use of higher ranks while achieving the same compression rates. First, we introduce an intra-layer shared low-rank projection method, where multiple matrices that share the same input use a common projection. This reduces redundancy and improves compression efficiency. Second, we propose a block skipping technique that omits computations and memory transfers for selected sub-blocks within the low-rank decomposition. These two techniques jointly enable our compressed model to retain more effective ranks under the same compression budget. Experimental results show that, without any additional fine-tuning, our method outperforms previous low-rank compression approaches by 7% accuracy improvement on zero-shot tasks under the same compression rate. These results highlight the effectiveness of our rank-maximized compression strategy in preserving model performance under tight resource constraints.

Abstract: This work introduces {\it PrahokBART}, a compact pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model trained from scratch for Khmer using carefully curated Khmer and English corpora. We focus on improving the pre-training corpus quality and addressing the linguistic issues of Khmer, which are ignored in existing multilingual models, by incorporating linguistic components such as word segmentation and normalization. We evaluate PrahokBART on three generative tasks: machine translation, text summarization, and headline generation, where our results demonstrate that it outperforms mBART50, a strong multilingual pre-trained model. Additionally, our analysis provides insights into the impact of each linguistic module and evaluates how effectively our model handles space during text generation, which is crucial for the naturalness of texts in Khmer.

Abstract: Verifying rumors on social media is critical for mitigating the spread of false information. The stances of conversation replies often provide important cues to determine a rumor's veracity. However, existing models struggle to jointly capture semantic content, stance information, and conversation strructure, especially under the sequence length constraints of transformer-based encoders. In this work, we propose a stance-aware structural modeling that encodes each post in a discourse with its stance signal and aggregates reply embedddings by stance category enabling a scalable and semantically enriched representation of the entire thread. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce stance distribution and hierarchical depth as covariates, capturing stance imbalance and the influence of reply depth. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms prior methods in the ability to predict truthfulness of a rumor. We also demonstrate that our model is versatile for early detection and cross-platfrom generalization.

Abstract: Memory has emerged, and will continue to remain, a core capability of foundation model-based agents. As research on agent memory rapidly expands and attracts unprecedented attention, the field has also become increasingly fragmented. Existing works that fall under the umbrella of agent memory often differ substantially in their motivations, implementations, and evaluation protocols, while the proliferation of loosely defined memory terminologies has further obscured conceptual clarity. Traditional taxonomies such as long/short-term memory have proven insufficient to capture the diversity of contemporary agent memory systems. This work aims to provide an up-to-date landscape of current agent memory research. We begin by clearly delineating the scope of agent memory and distinguishing it from related concepts such as LLM memory, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and context engineering. We then examine agent memory through the unified lenses of forms, functions, and dynamics. From the perspective of forms, we identify three dominant realizations of agent memory, namely token-level, parametric, and latent memory. From the perspective of functions, we propose a finer-grained taxonomy that distinguishes factual, experiential, and working memory. From the perspective of dynamics, we analyze how memory is formed, evolved, and retrieved over time. To support practical development, we compile a comprehensive summary of memory benchmarks and open-source frameworks. Beyond consolidation, we articulate a forward-looking perspective on emerging research frontiers, including memory automation, reinforcement learning integration, multimodal memory, multi-agent memory, and trustworthiness issues. We hope this survey serves not only as a reference for existing work, but also as a conceptual foundation for rethinking memory as a first-class primitive in the design of future agentic intelligence.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) are hindered by slow sequential inference. While masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a parallel alternative, they suffer from critical drawbacks: high computational overhead from precluding Key-Value (KV) caching, and incoherent generation arising from learning dependencies over an intractable space of token combinations. To address these limitations, we introduce ReFusion, a novel masked diffusion model that achieves superior performance and efficiency by elevating parallel decoding from the token level to a higher slot level, where each slot is a fixed-length, contiguous sub-sequence. This is achieved through an iterative ``plan-and-infill'' decoding process: a diffusion-based planning step first identifies a set of weakly dependent slots, and an autoregressive infilling step then decodes these selected slots in parallel. The slot-based design simultaneously unlocks full KV cache reuse with a unified causal framework and reduces the learning complexity from the token combination space to a manageable slot-level permutation space. Extensive experiments on seven diverse benchmarks show that ReFusion not only overwhelmingly surpasses prior MDMs with 34% performance gains and an over 18$\times$ speedup on average, but also bridges the performance gap to strong ARMs while maintaining a 2.33$\times$ average speedup.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 14 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations. Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection, revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors. This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at https://e-m-n-l-p.github.io/.

Abstract: A well-engineered prompt can increase the performance of large language models; automatic prompt optimization techniques aim to increase performance without requiring human effort to tune the prompts. One leading class of prompt optimization techniques introduces the analogy of textual gradients. We investigate the behavior of these textual gradient methods through a series of experiments and case studies. While such methods often result in a performance improvement, our experiments suggest that the gradient analogy does not accurately explain their behavior. Our insights may inform the selection of prompt optimization strategies, and development of new approaches.

Abstract: Building general-purpose reasoning models with reinforcement learning (RL) entails substantial cross-domain heterogeneity, including large variation in inference-time response lengths and verification latency. Such variability complicates the RL infrastructure, slows training, and makes training curriculum (e.g., response length extension) and hyperparameter selection challenging. In this work, we propose cascaded domain-wise reinforcement learning (Cascade RL) to develop general-purpose reasoning models, Nemotron-Cascade, capable of operating in both instruct and deep thinking modes. Departing from conventional approaches that blend heterogeneous prompts from different domains, Cascade RL orchestrates sequential, domain-wise RL, reducing engineering complexity and delivering state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks. Notably, RLHF for alignment, when used as a pre-step, boosts the model's reasoning ability far beyond mere preference optimization, and subsequent domain-wise RLVR stages rarely degrade the benchmark performance attained in earlier domains and may even improve it (see an illustration in Figure 1). Our 14B model, after RL, outperforms its SFT teacher, DeepSeek-R1-0528, on LiveCodeBench v5/v6/Pro and achieves silver-medal performance in the 2025 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We transparently share our training and data recipes.

Abstract: Representing continuous time is a critical and under-explored challenge in modeling temporal event sequences with large language models (LLMs). Various strategies like byte-level representations or calendar tokens have been proposed. However, the optimal approach remains unclear, especially given the diverse statistical distributions of real-world event data, which range from smooth log-normal to discrete, spiky patterns. This paper presents the first empirical study of temporal tokenization for event sequences, comparing distinct encoding strategies: naive numeric strings, high-precision byte-level representations, human-semantic calendar tokens, classic uniform binning, and adaptive residual scalar quantization. We evaluate these strategies by fine-tuning LLMs on real-world datasets that exemplify these diverse distributions. Our analysis reveals that no single strategy is universally superior; instead, prediction performance depends heavily on aligning the tokenizer with the data's statistical properties, with log-based strategies excelling on skewed distributions and human-centric formats proving robust for mixed modalities.

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have been shown to respond in a variety of ways for classification tasks outside of question-answering. LLM responses are sometimes called "hallucinations" since the output is not what is ex pected. Memorization strategies in LLMs are being studied in detail, with the goal of understanding how LLMs respond. We perform a deep dive into a classification task based on United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decisions. The SCOTUS corpus is an ideal classification task to study for LLM memory accuracy because it presents significant challenges due to extensive sentence length, complex legal terminology, non-standard structure, and domain-specific vocabulary. Experimentation is performed with the latest LLM fine tuning and retrieval-based approaches, such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning, auto-modeling, and others, on two traditional category-based SCOTUS classification tasks: one with 15 labeled topics and another with 279. We show that prompt-based models with memories, such as DeepSeek, can be more robust than previous BERT-based models on both tasks scoring about 2 points better than previous models not based on prompting.

Abstract: Safety alignment mechanisms in large language models prevent responses to harmful queries through learned refusal behavior, yet these same mechanisms impede legitimate research applications including cognitive modeling, adversarial testing, and security analysis. While abliteration techniques enable surgical removal of refusal representations through directional orthogonalization, the relative effectiveness of available implementations remains uncharacterized. This study evaluates four abliteration tools (Heretic, DECCP, ErisForge, FailSpy) across sixteen instruction-tuned models (7B-14B parameters), reporting tool compatibility on all 16 models and quantitative metrics on subsets dictated by tool support. Single-pass methods demonstrated superior capability preservation on the benchmarked subset (avg GSM8K change across three models: ErisForge -0.28 pp; DECCP -0.13 pp), while Bayesian-optimized abliteration produced variable distribution shift (KL divergence: 0.043-1.646) with model-dependent capability impact. These findings provide researchers with evidence-based selection criteria for abliteration tool deployment across diverse model architectures. The principal finding indicates that mathematical reasoning capabilities exhibit the highest sensitivity to abliteration interventions, with GSM8K change ranging from +1.51 pp to -18.81 pp (-26.5% relative) depending on tool selection and model architecture.

Abstract: Forensic scientists often need to identify an unknown speaker or writer in cases such as ransom calls, covert recordings, alleged suicide notes, or anonymous online communications, among many others. Speaker recognition in the speech domain usually examines phonetic or acoustic properties of a voice, and these methods can be accurate and robust under certain conditions. However, if a speaker disguises their voice or employs text-to-speech software, vocal properties may no longer be reliable, leaving only their linguistic content available for analysis. Authorship attribution methods traditionally use syntactic, semantic, and related linguistic information to identify writers of written text (authorship attribution). In this paper, we apply a content-based authorship approach to speech that has been transcribed into text, using what a speaker says to attribute speech to individuals (speaker attribution). We introduce a stylometric method, StyloSpeaker, which incorporates character, word, token, sentence, and style features from the stylometric literature on authorship, to assess whether two transcripts were produced by the same speaker. We evaluate this method on two types of transcript formatting: one approximating prescriptive written text with capitalization and punctuation and another normalized style that removes these conventions. The transcripts' conversation topics are also controlled to varying degrees. We find generally higher attribution performance on normalized transcripts, except under the strongest topic control condition, in which overall performance is highest. Finally, we compare this more explainable stylometric model to black-box neural approaches on the same data and investigate which stylistic features most effectively distinguish speakers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalization is becoming indispensable for LLMs to align with individual user preferences and needs. Yet current approaches are often computationally expensive, data-intensive, susceptible to catastrophic forgetting, and prone to performance degradation in multi-turn interactions or when handling implicit queries. To address these challenges, we conceptualize personalization as a model editing task and introduce Personalization Editing, a framework that applies localized edits guided by clustered preference representations. This design enables precise preference-aligned updates while preserving overall model capabilities. In addition, existing personalization benchmarks frequently rely on persona-based dialogs between LLMs rather than user-LLM interactions, or focus primarily on stylistic imitation while neglecting information-seeking tasks that require accurate recall of user-specific preferences. We introduce User Preference Question Answering (UPQA), a short-answer QA dataset constructed from in-situ user queries with varying levels of difficulty. Unlike prior benchmarks, UPQA directly evaluates a model's ability to recall and apply specific user preferences. Across experimental settings, Personalization Editing achieves higher editing accuracy and greater computational efficiency than fine-tuning, while outperforming prompting-based baselines in multi-turn conversations and implicit preference questions settings.

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that adversely affects cognitive abilities. Language-related changes can be automatically identified through the analysis of outputs from linguistic assessment tasks, such as picture description. Language models show promise as a basis for screening tools for AD, but their limited interpretability poses a challenge in distinguishing true linguistic markers of cognitive decline from surface-level textual patterns. To address this issue, we examine how surface form variation affects classification performance, with the goal of assessing the ability of language models to represent underlying semantic indicators. We introduce a novel approach where texts surface forms are transformed by altering syntax and vocabulary while preserving semantic content. The transformations significantly modify the structure and lexical content, as indicated by low BLEU and chrF scores, yet retain the underlying semantics, as reflected in high semantic similarity scores, isolating the effect of semantic information, and finding models perform similarly to if they were using the original text, with only small deviations in macro-F1. We also investigate whether language from picture descriptions retains enough detail to reconstruct the original image using generative models. We found that image-based transformations add substantial noise reducing classification accuracy. Our methodology provides a novel way of looking at what features influence model predictions, and allows the removal of possible spurious correlations. We find that just using semantic information, language model based classifiers can still detect AD. This work shows that difficult to detect semantic impairment can be identified, addressing an overlooked feature of linguistic deterioration, and opening new pathways for early detection systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as powerful yet opaque systems, leaving open how their internal memory and "self-like" behavior should be governed in a principled and auditable way. The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The task of finding efficient production schedules for parallel machines is a challenge that arises in most industrial manufacturing domains. There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting.

Abstract: Enemy strategies in turn-based games should be surprising and unpredictable. This study introduces Mirror Mode, a new game mode where the enemy AI mimics the personal strategy of a player to challenge them to keep changing their gameplay. A simplified version of the Nintendo strategy video game Fire Emblem Heroes has been built in Unity, with a Standard Mode and a Mirror Mode. Our first set of experiments find a suitable model for the task to imitate player demonstrations, using Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning: combining Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, and Proximal Policy Optimization. The second set of experiments evaluates the constructed model with player tests, where models are trained on demonstrations provided by participants. The gameplay of the participants indicates good imitation in defensive behavior, but not in offensive strategies. Participant's surveys indicated that they recognized their own retreating tactics, and resulted in an overall higher player-satisfaction for Mirror Mode. Refining the model further may improve imitation quality and increase player's satisfaction, especially when players face their own strategies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Model (LLM) agents requires conditioning them on user-specific data, creating a critical trade-off between task utility and data disclosure. While the utility of adding user data often exhibits diminishing returns (i.e., submodularity), enabling near-optimal greedy selection, real-world personalization is complicated by structural constraints. These include logical dependencies (e.g., selecting fact A requires fact B), categorical quotas (e.g., select at most one writing style), and hierarchical rules (e.g., select at most two social media preferences, of which at most one can be for a professional network). These constraints violate the assumptions of standard subset selection algorithms. We propose a principled method to formally model such constraints. We introduce a compilation process that transforms a user's knowledge graph with dependencies into a set of abstract macro-facets. Our central result is a proof that common hierarchical and quota-based constraints over these macro-facets form a valid laminar matroid. This theoretical characterization lets us cast structured personalization as submodular maximization under a matroid constraint, enabling greedy with constant-factor guarantees (and (1-1/e) via continuous greedy) for a much richer and more realistic class of problems.

Abstract: The nature of intelligence in both humans and machines is a longstanding question. While there is no universally accepted definition, the ability to reason causally is often regarded as a pivotal aspect of intelligence (Lake et al., 2017). Evaluating causal reasoning in LLMs and humans on the same tasks provides hence a more comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Our study asks: (Q1) Are LLMs aligned with humans given the \emph{same} reasoning tasks? (Q2) Do LLMs and humans reason consistently at the task level? (Q3) Do they have distinct reasoning signatures?
  We answer these by evaluating 20+ LLMs on eleven semantically meaningful causal tasks formalized by a collider graph ($C_1\!\to\!E\!\leftarrow\!C_2$ ) under \emph{Direct} (one-shot number as response = probability judgment of query node being one and \emph{Chain of Thought} (CoT; think first, then provide answer).
  Judgments are modeled with a leaky noisy-OR causal Bayes net (CBN) whose parameters $θ=(b,m_1,m_2,p(C)) \in [0,1]$ include a shared prior $p(C)$;
  we select the winning model via AIC between a 3-parameter symmetric causal strength ($m_1{=}m_2$) and 4-parameter asymmetric ($m_1{\neq}m_2$) variant.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A systematic, comparative investigation into the effects of low-quality data reveals a stark spectrum of robustness across modern probabilistic models. We find that autoregressive language models, from token prediction to sequence-to-sequence tasks, are remarkably resilient (for GPT-2, test NLL increases modestly from 2.87 to 3.59 despite 50% token corruption). By contrast, under the same levels of data corruption, class-conditional diffusion models degrade catastrophically (image-label consistency plummets by 56.81% relative to baseline), while classifiers show a moderate impact that diminishes with dataset scale. To explain these discrepancies, we analyze the results through a multi-perspective lens, integrating information theory, PAC learning, and gradient dynamics. These analyses suggest that robustness is heavily influenced by two key principles: the richness of conditioning information, which constrains the learning problem, and the absolute information content of the training data, which allows the signal from correct information to dominate statistical noise.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, but their deployment in datacenter environments faces significant challenges due to the massive memory requirements of key-value (KV) caches. During the autoregressive decoding process, KV caches consume substantial GPU memory, limiting batch sizes and overall system throughput. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{CXL-SpecKV}, a novel disaggregated KV-cache architecture that leverages Compute Express Link (CXL) interconnects and FPGA accelerators to enable efficient speculative execution and memory disaggregation. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (i) a CXL-based memory disaggregation framework that offloads KV-caches to remote FPGA memory with low latency, (ii) a speculative KV-cache prefetching mechanism that predicts and preloads future tokens' cache entries, and (iii) an FPGA-accelerated KV-cache compression and decompression engine that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by up to 4$\times$. When evaluated on state-of-the-art LLM models, CXL-SpecKV achieves up to 3.2$\times$ higher throughput compared to GPU-only baselines, while reducing memory costs by 2.8$\times$ and maintaining accuracy. Our system demonstrates that intelligent memory disaggregation combined with speculative execution can effectively address the memory wall challenge in large-scale LLM serving. Our code implementation has been open-sourced at https://github.com/FastLM/CXL-SpecKV.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (AtomGPT.org API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/agapi.

Abstract: Differences in perception, information asymmetries, and bounded rationality lead game-theoretic players to derive a private, subjective view of the game that may diverge from the underlying ground-truth scenario and may be misaligned with other players' interpretations. While typical game-theoretic assumptions often overlook such heterogeneity, hypergame theory provides the mathematical framework to reason about mismatched mental models. Although hypergames have recently gained traction in dynamic applications concerning uncertainty, their practical adoption in multi-agent system research has been hindered by the lack of a unifying, formal, and practical representation language, as well as scalable algorithms for managing complex hypergame structures and equilibria. Our work addresses this gap by introducing a declarative, logic-based domain-specific language for encoding hypergame structures and hypergame solution concepts. Leveraging answer-set programming, we develop an automated pipeline for instantiating hypergame structures and running our novel hypergame rationalisation procedure, a mechanism for finding belief structures that justify seemingly irrational outcomes. The proposed language establishes a unifying formalism for hypergames and serves as a foundation for developing nuanced, belief-based heterogeneous reasoners, offering a verifiable context with logical guarantees. Together, these contributions establish the connection between hypergame theory, multi-agent systems, and strategic AI.

Abstract: System logs are a critical resource for monitoring and managing distributed systems, providing insights into failures and anomalous behavior. Traditional log analysis techniques, including template-based and sequence-driven approaches, often lose important semantic information or struggle with ambiguous log patterns. To address this, we present EnrichLog, a training-free, entry-based anomaly detection framework that enriches raw log entries with both corpus-specific and sample-specific knowledge. EnrichLog incorporates contextual information, including historical examples and reasoning derived from the corpus, to enable more accurate and interpretable anomaly detection. The framework leverages retrieval-augmented generation to integrate relevant contextual knowledge without requiring retraining. We evaluate EnrichLog on four large-scale system log benchmark datasets and compare it against five baseline methods. Our results show that EnrichLog consistently improves anomaly detection performance, effectively handles ambiguous log entries, and maintains efficient inference. Furthermore, incorporating both corpus- and sample-specific knowledge enhances model confidence and detection accuracy, making EnrichLog well-suited for practical deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel context-sensitive multi\-agent coordination for dynamic resource allocation (CAMAC-DRA) framework for optimizing smart electric vehicle (EV) charging ecosystems through the Smart2Charge application. The proposed system coordinates autonomous charging agents across networks of 250 EVs and 45 charging stations while adapting to dynamic environmental conditions through context-aware decision-making. Our multi-agent approach employs coordinated Deep Q\-Networks integrated with Graph Neural Networks and attention mechanisms, processing 20 contextual features including weather patterns, traffic conditions, grid load fluctuations, and electricity pricing.The framework balances five ecosystem stakeholders i.e. EV users (25\%), grid operators (20\%), charging station operators (20\%), fleet operators (20%), and environmental factors (15\%) through weighted coordination mechanisms and consensus protocols. Comprehensive validation using real-world datasets containing 441,077 charging transactions demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline algorithms including DDPG, A3C, PPO, and GNN approaches. The CAMAC\-DRA framework achieves 92\% coordination success rate, 15\% energy efficiency improvement, 10\% cost reduction, 20% grid strain decrease, and \2.3x faster convergence while maintaining 88\% training stability and 85\% sample efficiency. Real-world validation confirms commercial viability with Net Present Cost of -\$122,962 and 69\% cost reduction through renewable energy integration. The framework's unique contribution lies in developing context-aware multi-stakeholder coordination that successfully balances competing objectives while adapting to real-time variables, positioning it as a breakthrough solution for intelligent EV charging coordination and sustainable transportation electrification.

Abstract: Monitoring forecasting systems is critical for customer satisfaction, profitability, and operational efficiency in large-scale retail businesses. We propose The Forecast Critic, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated forecast monitoring, taking advantage of their broad world knowledge and strong ``reasoning'' capabilities. As a prerequisite for this, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to assess time series forecast quality, focusing on three key questions. (1) Can LLMs be deployed to perform forecast monitoring and identify obviously unreasonable forecasts? (2) Can LLMs effectively incorporate unstructured exogenous features to assess what a reasonable forecast looks like? (3) How does performance vary across model sizes and reasoning capabilities, measured across state-of-the-art LLMs? We present three experiments, including on both synthetic and real-world forecasting data. Our results show that LLMs can reliably detect and critique poor forecasts, such as those plagued by temporal misalignment, trend inconsistencies, and spike errors. The best-performing model we evaluated achieves an F1 score of 0.88, somewhat below human-level performance (F1 score: 0.97). We also demonstrate that multi-modal LLMs can effectively incorporate unstructured contextual signals to refine their assessment of the forecast. Models correctly identify missing or spurious promotional spikes when provided with historical context about past promotions (F1 score: 0.84). Lastly, we demonstrate that these techniques succeed in identifying inaccurate forecasts on the real-world M5 time series dataset, with unreasonable forecasts having an sCRPS at least 10% higher than that of reasonable forecasts. These findings suggest that LLMs, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, may provide a viable and scalable option for automated forecast monitoring and evaluation.

Abstract: In a recent work, we proposed Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI), that restores policy iteration's monotonicity-of-value-estimates property to the function approximation setting. Here, we assess the robustness of RPI's empirical performance on two classical control tasks -- CartPole and Inverted Pendulum -- under changes to neural network and environmental parameters. Relative to DQN, Double DQN, DDPG, TD3, and PPO, RPI reaches near-optimal performance early and sustains this policy as training proceeds. Because deep RL methods are often hampered by sample inefficiency, training instability, and hyperparameter sensitivity, our results highlight RPI's promise as a more reliable alternative.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform in-context learning (ICL) with minimal supervised examples, which benefits various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. One of the critical research focus is the selection of prompt demonstrations. Current approaches typically employ retrieval models to select the top-K most semantically similar examples as demonstrations. However, we argue that existing methods are limited since the label consistency is not guaranteed during demonstration selection. Our cognition derives from the Bayesian view of ICL and our rethinking of ICL from the transductive label propagation perspective. We treat ICL as a transductive learning method and incorporate latent concepts from Bayesian view and deduce that similar demonstrations guide the concepts of query, with consistent labels serving as estimates. Based on this understanding, we establish a label propagation framework to link label consistency with propagation error bounds. To model label consistency, we propose a data synthesis method, leveraging both semantic and label information, and use TopK sampling with Synthetic Data (TopK-SD) to acquire demonstrations with consistent labels. TopK-SD outperforms original TopK sampling on multiple benchmarks. Our work provides a new perspective for understanding the working mechanisms within ICL.

Abstract: Indoor navigation remains a critical challenge for people with visual impairments. The current solutions mainly rely on infrastructure-based systems, which limit their ability to navigate safely in dynamic environments. We propose a novel navigation approach that utilizes a foundation model to transform floor plans into navigable knowledge graphs and generate human-readable navigation instructions. Floorplan2Guide integrates a large language model (LLM) to extract spatial information from architectural layouts, reducing the manual preprocessing required by earlier floorplan parsing methods. Experimental results indicate that few-shot learning improves navigation accuracy in comparison to zero-shot learning on simulated and real-world evaluations. Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves the highest accuracy among the evaluated models, with 92.31%, 76.92%, and 61.54% on the short, medium, and long routes, respectively, under 5-shot prompting of the MP-1 floor plan. The success rate of graph-based spatial structure is 15.4% higher than that of direct visual reasoning among all models, which confirms that graphical representation and in-context learning enhance navigation performance and make our solution more precise for indoor navigation of Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), thanks to their concise and efficient triple-based structure, have been widely applied in intelligent question answering, recommender systems and other domains. However, the heterogeneous and multifaceted nature of real-world data inevitably renders the distribution of relations long-tailed, making it crucial to complete missing facts with limited samples. Previous studies mainly based on metric matching or meta learning, yet they either fail to fully exploit neighborhood information in graph or overlook the distributional characteristics of contrastive signals. In this paper, we re-examine the problem from a perspective of generative representation and propose a few-shot knowledge graph completion framework that integrates two-stage attention triple enhancer with U-KAN based diffusion model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method achieve new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Human cognition spans perception, memory, intuitive judgment, deliberative reasoning, action selection, and social inference, yet these capacities are often explained through distinct computational theories. Here we present a unified mathematical framework in which diverse cognitive processes emerge from a single geometric principle. We represent the cognitive state as a point on a differentiable manifold endowed with a learned Riemannian metric that encodes representational constraints, computational costs, and structural relations among cognitive variables. A scalar cognitive potential combines predictive accuracy, structural parsimony, task utility, and normative or logical requirements. Cognition unfolds as the Riemannian gradient flow of this potential, providing a universal dynamical law from which a broad range of psychological phenomena arise. Classical dual-process effects--rapid intuitive responses and slower deliberative reasoning--emerge naturally from metric-induced anisotropies that generate intrinsic time-scale separations and geometric phase transitions, without invoking modular or hybrid architectures. We derive analytical conditions for these regimes and demonstrate their behavioural signatures through simulations of canonical cognitive tasks. Together, these results establish a geometric foundation for cognition and suggest guiding principles for the development of more general and human-like artificial intelligence systems.

Abstract: Traditional ontology design emphasizes disjoint and exhaustive top-level distinctions such as continuant vs. occurrent, abstract vs. concrete, or type vs. instance. These distinctions are used to structure unified hierarchies where every entity is classified under a single upper-level category. Wikidata, by contrast, does not enforce a singular foundational taxonomy. Instead, it accommodates multiple classification axes simultaneously under the shared root class entity. This paper analyzes the structural implications of Wikidata's polyhierarchical and multi-axial design. The Wikidata architecture enables a scalable and modular approach to ontology construction, especially suited to collaborative and evolving knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Conventional generative models for materials discovery are predominantly trained and validated using data from Density Functional Theory (DFT) with approximate exchange-correlation functionals. This creates a fundamental bottleneck: these models inherit DFT's systematic failures for strongly correlated systems, leading to exploration biases and an inability to discover materials where DFT predictions are qualitatively incorrect. We introduce a quantum-aware generative AI framework that systematically addresses this limitation through tight integration of multi-fidelity learning and active validation. Our approach employs a diffusion-based generator conditioned on quantum-mechanical descriptors and a validator using an equivariant neural network potential trained on a hierarchical dataset spanning multiple levels of theory (PBE, SCAN, HSE06, CCSD(T)). Crucially, we implement a robust active learning loop that quantifies and targets the divergence between low- and high-fidelity predictions. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to deconstruct the contribution of each component, perform detailed failure mode analysis, and benchmark our framework against state-of-the-art generative models (CDVAE, GNoME, DiffCSP) across several challenging material classes. Our results demonstrate significant practical gains: a 3-5x improvement in successfully identifying potentially stable candidates in high-divergence regions (e.g., correlated oxides) compared to DFT-only baselines, while maintaining computational feasibility. This work provides a rigorous, transparent framework for extending the effective search space of computational materials discovery beyond the limitations of single-fidelity models.

Abstract: Intelligent systems are widely assumed to improve through learning, coordination, and optimization. However, across domains -- from artificial intelligence to economic institutions and biological evolution -- increasing intelligence often precipitates paradoxical degradation: systems become rigid, lose adaptability, and fail unexpectedly.
  We identify \emph{entropy collapse} as a universal dynamical failure mode arising when feedback amplification outpaces bounded novelty regeneration. Under minimal domain-agnostic assumptions, we show that intelligent systems undergo a sharp transition from high-entropy adaptive regimes to low-entropy collapsed regimes. Collapse is formalized as convergence toward a stable low-entropy manifold, not a zero-entropy state, implying a contraction of effective adaptive dimensionality rather than loss of activity or scale.
  We analytically establish critical thresholds, dynamical irreversibility, and attractor structure and demonstrate universality across update mechanisms through minimal simulations. This framework unifies diverse phenomena -- model collapse in AI, institutional sclerosis in economics, and genetic bottlenecks in evolution -- as manifestations of the same underlying process.
  By reframing collapse as a structural cost of intelligence, our results clarify why late-stage interventions systematically fail and motivate entropy-aware design principles for sustaining long-term adaptability in intelligent systems.

Abstract: Recent work from Anthropic claims that frontier models can sometimes detect and name injected "concepts" represented as activation directions. We test the robustness of these claims. First, we reproduce Anthropic's multi-turn "emergent introspection" result on Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, finding that the model identifies and names the injected concept 20 percent of the time under Anthropic's original pipeline, exactly matching their reported numbers and thus showing that introspection is not exclusive to very large or capable models. Second, we systematically vary the inference prompt and find that introspection is fragile: performance collapses on closely related tasks such as multiple-choice identification of the injected concept or different prompts of binary discrimination of whether a concept was injected at all. Third, we identify a contrasting regime of partial introspection: the same model can reliably classify the strength of the coefficient of a normalized injected concept vector (as weak / moderate / strong / very strong) with up to 70 percent accuracy, far above the 25 percent chance baseline. Together, these results provide more evidence for Anthropic's claim that language models effectively compute a function of their baseline, internal representations during introspection; however, these self-reports about those representations are narrow and prompt-sensitive.

Abstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly embedded in everyday work and learning, yet their fluency, opacity, and propensity to hallucinate mean that users must critically evaluate AI outputs rather than accept them at face value. The present research conceptualises critical thinking in AI use as a dispositional tendency to verify the source and content of AI-generated information, to understand how models work and where they fail, and to reflect on the broader implications of relying on AI. Across six studies (N = 1365), we developed and validated the 13-item critical thinking in AI use scale and mapped its nomological network. Study 1 generated and content-validated scale items. Study 2 supported a three-factor structure (Verification, Motivation, and Reflection). Studies 3, 4, and 5 confirmed this higher-order model, demonstrated internal consistency and test-retest reliability, strong factor loadings, sex invariance, and convergent and discriminant validity. Studies 3 and 4 further revealed that critical thinking in AI use was positively associated with openness, extraversion, positive trait affect, and frequency of AI use. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrated criterion validity of the scale, with higher critical thinking in AI use scores predicting more frequent and diverse verification strategies, greater veracity-judgement accuracy in a novel and naturalistic ChatGPT-powered fact-checking task, and deeper reflection about responsible AI. Taken together, the current work clarifies why and how people exercise oversight over generative AI outputs and provides a validated scale and ecologically grounded task paradigm to support theory testing, cross-group, and longitudinal research on critical engagement with generative AI outputs.

Abstract: AI model documentation is fragmented across platforms and inconsistent in structure, preventing policymakers, auditors, and users from reliably assessing safety claims, data provenance, and version-level changes. We analyzed documentation from five frontier models (Gemini 3, Grok 4.1, Llama 4, GPT-5, and Claude 4.5) and 100 Hugging Face model cards, identifying 947 unique section names with extreme naming variation. Usage information alone appeared under 97 distinct labels. Using the EU AI Act Annex IV and the Stanford Transparency Index as baselines, we developed a weighted transparency framework with 8 sections and 23 subsections that prioritizes safety-critical disclosures (Safety Evaluation: 25%, Critical Risk: 20%) over technical specifications. We implemented an automated multi-agent pipeline that extracts documentation from public sources and scores completeness through LLM-based consensus. Evaluating 50 models across vision, multimodal, open-source, and closed-source systems cost less than $3 in total and revealed systematic gaps. Frontier labs (xAI, Microsoft, Anthropic) achieve approximately 80% compliance, while most providers fall below 60%. Safety-critical categories show the largest deficits: deception behaviors, hallucinations, and child safety evaluations account for 148, 124, and 116 aggregate points lost, respectively, across all evaluated models.

Abstract: Node importance estimation (NIE) in heterogeneous knowledge graphs is a critical yet challenging task, essential for applications such as recommendation, knowledge reasoning, and question answering. Existing methods often rely on pairwise connections, neglecting high-order dependencies among multiple entities and relations, and they treat structural and semantic signals independently, hindering effective cross-modal integration. To address these challenges, we propose MetaHGNIE, a meta-path induced hypergraph contrastive learning framework for disentangling and aligning structural and semantic information. MetaHGNIE constructs a higher-order knowledge graph via meta-path sequences, where typed hyperedges capture multi-entity relational contexts. Structural dependencies are aggregated with local attention, while semantic representations are encoded through a hypergraph transformer equipped with sparse chunking to reduce redundancy. Finally, a multimodal fusion module integrates structural and semantic embeddings under contrastive learning with auxiliary supervision, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark NIE datasets demonstrate that MetaHGNIE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly modeling higher-order interactions and cross-modal alignment in heterogeneous knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created unprecedented opportunities for creative expression, education, and research. Text-to-image systems such as DALL.E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney can now convert ideas into visuals within seconds, but they also present a dual-use dilemma, raising critical ethical concerns: amplifying societal biases, producing high-fidelity disinformation, and violating intellectual property. This paper introduces SafeGen, a framework that embeds ethical safeguards directly into the text-to-image generation pipeline, grounding its design in established principles for Trustworthy AI. SafeGen integrates two complementary components: BGE-M3, a fine-tuned text classifier that filters harmful or misleading prompts, and Hyper-SD, an optimized diffusion model that produces high fidelity, semantically aligned images. Built on a curated multilingual (English- Vietnamese) dataset and a fairness-aware training process, SafeGen demonstrates that creative freedom and ethical responsibility can be reconciled within a single workflow. Quantitative evaluations confirm its effectiveness, with Hyper-SD achieving IS = 3.52, FID = 22.08, and SSIM = 0.79, while BGE-M3 reaches an F1-Score of 0.81. An ablation study further validates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning for both modules. Case studies illustrate SafeGen's practical impact in blocking unsafe prompts, generating inclusive teaching materials, and reinforcing academic integrity.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable progress across many visual-language tasks; however, their capacity to evaluate artistic expression remains limited. Aesthetic concepts are inherently abstract and open-ended, and multimodal artwork annotations are scarce. We introduce KidsArtBench, a new benchmark of over 1k children's artworks (ages 5-15) annotated by 12 expert educators across 9 rubric-aligned dimensions, together with expert comments for feedback. Unlike prior aesthetic datasets that provide single scalar scores on adult imagery, KidsArtBench targets children's artwork and pairs multi-dimensional annotations with comment supervision to enable both ordinal assessment and formative feedback. Building on this resource, we propose an attribute-specific multi-LoRA approach, where each attribute corresponds to a distinct evaluation dimension (e.g., Realism, Imagination) in the scoring rubric, with Regression-Aware Fine-Tuning (RAFT) to align predictions with ordinal scales. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our method increases correlation from 0.468 to 0.653, with the largest gains on perceptual dimensions and narrowed gaps on higher-order attributes. These results show that educator-aligned supervision and attribute-aware training yield pedagogically meaningful evaluations and establish a rigorous testbed for sustained progress in educational AI. We release data and code with ethics documentation.

Abstract: Patch foraging involves the deliberate and planned process of determining the optimal time to depart from a resource-rich region and investigate potentially more beneficial alternatives. The Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) is frequently used to characterize this process, offering an optimality model for such foraging behaviors. Although this model has been widely used to make predictions in behavioral ecology, discovering the computational mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of optimal patch-foraging decisions in biological foragers remains under investigation. Here, we show that artificial foragers equipped with learned world models naturally converge to MVT-aligned strategies. Using a model-based reinforcement learning agent that acquires a parsimonious predictive representation of its environment, we demonstrate that anticipatory capabilities, rather than reward maximization alone, drive efficient patch-leaving behavior. Compared with standard model-free RL agents, these model-based agents exhibit decision patterns similar to many of their biological counterparts, suggesting that predictive world models can serve as a foundation for more explainable and biologically grounded decision-making in AI systems. Overall, our findings highlight the value of ecological optimality principles for advancing interpretable and adaptive AI.

Abstract: Problem definition: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into business decision making, their potential to replicate and even amplify human cognitive biases cautions a significant, yet not well-understood, risk. This is particularly critical in high-stakes operational contexts like supply chain management. To address this, we investigate the decision-making patterns of leading LLMs using the canonical newsvendor problem in a dynamic setting, aiming to identify the nature and origins of their cognitive biases. Methodology/results: Through dynamic, multi-round experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-8B, we tested for five established decision biases. We found that LLMs consistently replicated the classic ``Too Low/Too High'' ordering bias and significantly amplified other tendencies like demand-chasing behavior compared to human benchmarks. Our analysis uncovered a ``paradox of intelligence'': the more sophisticated GPT-4 demonstrated the greatest irrationality through overthinking, while the efficiency-optimized GPT-4o performed near-optimally. Because these biases persist even when optimal formulas are provided, we conclude they stem from architectural constraints rather than knowledge gaps. Managerial implications: First, managers should select models based on the specific task, as our results show that efficiency-optimized models can outperform more complex ones on certain optimization problems. Second, the significant amplification of bias by LLMs highlights the urgent need for robust human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes decisions to prevent costly errors. Third, our findings suggest that designing structured, rule-based prompts is a practical and effective strategy for managers to constrain models' heuristic tendencies and improve the reliability of AI-assisted decisions.

Abstract: LLM agents that use external tools can solve complex tasks, but understanding which tools actually contributed to a response remains a blind spot. No existing XAI methods address tool-level explanations. We introduce AgentSHAP, the first framework for explaining tool importance in LLM agents. AgentSHAP is model-agnostic: it treats the agent as a black box and works with any LLM (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.) without needing access to internal weights or gradients. Using Monte Carlo Shapley values, AgentSHAP tests how an agent responds with different tool subsets and computes fair importance scores based on game theory. Our contributions are: (1) the first explainability method for agent tool attribution, grounded in Shapley values from game theory; (2) Monte Carlo sampling that reduces cost from O(2n) to practical levels; and (3) comprehensive experiments on API-Bank showing that AgentSHAP produces consistent scores across runs, correctly identifies which tools matter, and distinguishes relevant from irrelevant tools. AgentSHAP joins TokenSHAP (for tokens) and PixelSHAP (for image regions) to complete a family of Shapley-based XAI tools for modern generative AI. Code: https://github.com/GenAISHAP/TokenSHAP.

Abstract: Mobile GUI Agents, AI agents capable of interacting with mobile applications on behalf of users, have the potential to transform human computer interaction. However, current evaluation practices for GUI agents face two fundamental limitations. First, they either rely on single path offline benchmarks or online live benchmarks. Offline benchmarks using static, single path annotated datasets unfairly penalize valid alternative actions, while online benchmarks suffer from poor scalability and reproducibility due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of live evaluation. Second, existing benchmarks treat agents as monolithic black boxes, overlooking the contributions of individual components, which often leads to unfair comparisons or obscures key performance bottlenecks. To address these limitations, we present MobiBench, the first modular and multi path aware offline benchmarking framework for mobile GUI agents that enables high fidelity, scalable, and reproducible evaluation entirely in offline settings. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiBench achieves 94.72 percent agreement with human evaluators, on par with carefully engineered online benchmarks, while preserving the scalability and reproducibility of static offline benchmarks. Furthermore, our comprehensive module level analysis uncovers several key insights, including a systematic evaluation of diverse techniques used in mobile GUI agents, optimal module configurations across model scales, the inherent limitations of current LFMs, and actionable guidelines for designing more capable and cost efficient mobile agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of value awareness in AI, which goes beyond the traditional value-alignment problem. Our definition of value awareness presents us with a concise and simplified roadmap for engineering value-aware AI. The roadmap is structured around three core pillars: (1) learning and representing human values using formal semantics, (2) ensuring the value alignment of both individual agents and multiagent systems, and (3) providing value-based explainability on behaviour. The paper presents a selection of our ongoing work on some of these topics, along with applications to real-life domains.

Abstract: Agentic memory is emerging as a key enabler for large language models (LLM) to maintain continuity, personalization, and long-term context in extended user interactions, critical capabilities for deploying LLMs as truly interactive and adaptive agents. Agentic memory refers to the memory that provides an LLM with agent-like persistence: the ability to retain and act upon information across conversations, similar to how a human would. We present Memoria, a modular memory framework that augments LLM-based conversational systems with persistent, interpretable, and context-rich memory. Memoria integrates two complementary components: dynamic session-level summarization and a weighted knowledge graph (KG)-based user modelling engine that incrementally captures user traits, preferences, and behavioral patterns as structured entities and relationships. This hybrid architecture enables both short-term dialogue coherence and long-term personalization while operating within the token constraints of modern LLMs. We demonstrate how Memoria enables scalable, personalized conversational artificial intelligence (AI) by bridging the gap between stateless LLM interfaces and agentic memory systems, offering a practical solution for industry applications requiring adaptive and evolving user experiences.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based agents often operate in a greedy, step-by-step manner, selecting actions solely based on the current observation without considering long-term consequences or alternative paths. This lack of foresight is particularly problematic in web environments, which are only partially observable-limited to browser-visible content (e.g., DOM and UI elements)-where a single misstep often requires complex and brittle navigation to undo. Without an explicit backtracking mechanism, agents struggle to correct errors or systematically explore alternative paths. Tree-search methods provide a principled framework for such structured exploration, but existing approaches lack mechanisms for safe backtracking, making them prone to unintended side effects. They also assume that all actions are reversible, ignoring the presence of irreversible actions-limitations that reduce their effectiveness in realistic web tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce WebOperator, a tree-search framework that enables reliable backtracking and strategic exploration. Our method incorporates a best-first search strategy that ranks actions by both reward estimates and safety considerations, along with a robust backtracking mechanism that verifies the feasibility of previously visited paths before replaying them, preventing unintended side effects. To further guide exploration, WebOperator generates action candidates from multiple, varied reasoning contexts to ensure diverse and robust exploration, and subsequently curates a high-quality action set by filtering out invalid actions pre-execution and merging semantically equivalent ones. Experimental results on WebArena and WebVoyager demonstrate the effectiveness of WebOperator. On WebArena, WebOperator achieves a state-of-the-art 54.6% success rate with gpt-4o, underscoring the critical advantage of integrating strategic foresight with safe execution.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of the "Games as a Service" model necessitates frequent content updates, placing immense pressure on quality assurance. In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness.

Abstract: Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction is a critical component of modern multimedia systems, particularly for adaptive video streaming in 5G networks. Accurate QoE estimation enables intelligent resource management and supports user centric service delivery. Existing QoE prediction approaches primarily rely on limited datasets and assume uniform user perception, which restricts their applicability in heterogeneous real world environments.
  This paper proposes a demographic aware machine learning framework for personalized QoE prediction. We introduce a behaviorally realistic demographic based data augmentation strategy that expands a small QoE dataset six fold by modeling varying user sensitivities to streaming impairments such as rebuffering, bitrate variation, and quality degradation. Using the augmented dataset, we evaluate a comprehensive set of classical machine learning models alongside advanced deep learning architectures, including an attention-based MLP and TabNet.
  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy across RMSE, MAE, and R metrics compared to baseline models. Among all evaluated approaches, TabNet achieves the strongest performance, benefiting from its inherent feature selection and attention mechanisms. The results confirm that demographic-aware augmentation substantially enhances QoE prediction robustness and provides a scalable direction for personalized QoE-aware intelligence in 5G video streaming networks.

Abstract: I develop a novel semantics for probabilities of counterfactuals that generalizes the standard Pearlian semantics: it applies to probabilistic causal models that cannot be extended into realistic structural causal models and are therefore beyond the scope of Pearl's semantics. This generalization is needed because, as I show, such probabilistic causal models arise even in simple settings. My semantics offer a natural compromize in the long-standing debate between Pearl and Dawid over counterfactuals: I agree with Dawid that universal causal determinism and unrealistic variables should be rejected, but I agree with Pearl that a general semantics of counterfactuals is nonetheless possible. I restrict attention to causal models that satisfy the Markov condition, only contain realistic variables, and are causally complete. Although I formulate my proposal using structural causal models, as does Pearl, I refrain from using so-called response variables. Moreover, I prove that my semantics is equivalent to two other recent proposals that do not involve structural causal models, and that it is in line with various comments on stochastic counterfactuals that have appeared in the literature more broadly. Throughout I also reflect on the universality of the Markov condition and explore a novel generalization of causal abstractions

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive code generators to autonomous agents introduces significant safety risks, specifically regarding destructive commands and inconsistent system states. Existing commercial solutions often prioritize interactive user safety, enforcing authentication barriers that break the headless loops required for true autonomy. This paper presents a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework designed to mitigate these risks through a policy-based interception layer and a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism. We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation. Experimental results demonstrate a 100\% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100\% success rate in rolling back failed states. Crucially, our prototype incurs only a 14.5\% performance overhead (approx. 1.8s) per transaction. In contrast, benchmarking against the Gemini CLI sandbox revealed that it requires interactive authentication ("Sign in"), rendering it unusable for headless, autonomous agent workflows.

Abstract: As generative agents become increasingly sophisticated and deployed in long-term interactive scenarios, their memory management capabilities emerge as a critical bottleneck for both performance and privacy. Current approaches either maintain unlimited memory stores, leading to computational intractability and privacy concerns, or employ simplistic forgetting mechanisms that compromise agent coherence and functionality. This paper introduces the Memory-Aware Retention Schema (MaRS), a novel framework for human-centered memory management in generative agents, coupled with six theoretically-grounded forgetting policies that balance performance, privacy, and computational efficiency. We present the Forgetful but Faithful Agent (FiFA) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses agent performance across narrative coherence, goal completion, social recall accuracy, privacy preservation, and cost efficiency. Through extensive experimentation involving 300 evaluation runs across multiple memory budgets and agent configurations, we demonstrate that our hybrid forgetting policy achieves superior performance (composite score: 0.911) while maintaining computational tractability and privacy guarantees. Our work establishes new benchmarks for memory-budgeted agent evaluation and provides practical guidelines for deploying generative agents in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments. The theoretical foundations, implementation framework, and empirical results contribute to the emerging field of human-centered AI by addressing fundamental challenges in agent memory management that directly impact user trust, system scalability, and regulatory compliance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides interpretable rule learning in relational domains, yet remains limited in its ability to induce and reason with numerical constraints. Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.

Abstract: Self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without reliance on expensive human-annotated data. However, we find that existing methods suffer from a critical failure mode under long-horizon training: a "policy collapse" where performance precipitously degrades. We diagnose this instability and demonstrate that simply scaling the number of rollouts -- a common strategy to improve performance -- only delays, but does not prevent, this collapse. To counteract this instability, we first introduce M-GRPO (Momentum-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that leverages a slowly evolving momentum model to provide a stable training target. In addition, we identify that this process is often accompanied by a rapid collapse in policy entropy, resulting in a prematurely confident and suboptimal policy. To specifically address this issue, we propose a second contribution: an adaptive filtering method based on the interquartile range (IQR) that dynamically prunes low-entropy trajectories, preserving essential policy diversity. Our extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that M-GRPO stabilizes the training process while the IQR filter prevents premature convergence. The combination of these two innovations leads to superior training stability and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at static interactions, where they answer user queries by retrieving knowledge encoded in their parameters. However, in many real-world settings, such as educational tutoring or medical assistance, relevant information is not directly available and must be actively acquired through dynamic interactions. An interactive agent would recognize its own uncertainty, ask targeted questions, and retain new knowledge efficiently. Prior work has primarily explored effective ways for a teacher to instruct the student, where the teacher identifies student gaps and provides guidance. In this work, we shift the focus to the student and investigate effective strategies to actively query the teacher in seeking useful information. Across math and coding benchmarks, where baseline student models begin with near-zero performance, we show that student-led approaches consistently yield absolute Pass@k improvements of at least 0.5 over static baselines. To improve question quality, we train students using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with guidance from either self or stronger students. We find that this guided training enables smaller models to learn how to ask better questions, further enhancing learning efficiency.

Abstract: Generating 3D-based body movements from speech shows great potential in extensive downstream applications, while it still suffers challenges in imitating realistic human movements. Predominant research efforts focus on end-to-end generation schemes to generate co-speech gestures, spanning GANs, VQ-VAE, and recent diffusion models. As an ill-posed problem, in this paper, we argue that these prevailing learning schemes fail to model crucial inter- and intra-correlations across different motion units, i.e. head, body, and hands, thus leading to unnatural movements and poor coordination. To delve into these intrinsic correlations, we propose a unified Hierarchical Implicit Periodicity (HIP) learning approach for audio-inspired 3D gesture generation. Different from predominant research, our approach models this multi-modal implicit relationship by two explicit technique insights: i) To disentangle the complicated gesture movements, we first explore the gesture motion phase manifolds with periodic autoencoders to imitate human natures from realistic distributions while incorporating non-period ones from current latent states for instance-level diversities. ii) To model the hierarchical relationship of face motions, body gestures, and hand movements, driving the animation with cascaded guidance during learning. We exhibit our proposed approach on 3D avatars and extensive experiments show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art co-speech gesture generation methods by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.

Abstract: Conversational agents often encounter ambiguous user requests, requiring an effective clarification to successfully complete tasks. While recent advancements in real-world applications favor multi-agent architectures to manage complex conversational scenarios efficiently, ambiguity resolution remains a critical and underexplored challenge--particularly due to the difficulty of determining which agent should initiate a clarification and how agents should coordinate their actions when faced with uncertain or incomplete user input. The fundamental questions of when to interrupt a user and how to formulate the optimal clarification query within the most optimal multi-agent settings remain open. In this paper, we propose MAC (Multi-Agent Clarification), an interactive multi-agent framework specifically optimized to resolve user ambiguities by strategically managing clarification dialogues. We first introduce a novel taxonomy categorizing user ambiguities to systematically guide clarification strategies. Then, we present MAC that autonomously coordinates multiple agents to interact synergistically with users. Empirical evaluations on MultiWOZ 2.4 demonstrate that enabling clarification at both levels increases task success rate 7.8\% (54.5 to 62.3) and reduces the average number of dialogue turns (6.53 to 4.86) by eliciting all required user information up front and minimizing repetition. Our findings highlight the importance of active user interaction and role-aware clarification for more reliable human-agent communication.

Abstract: Effective human-agent collaboration is increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. Current trends in such collaborations are predominantly unidirectional, with users providing instructions or posing questions to agents, where agents respond directly without seeking necessary clarifications or confirmations. However, the evolving capabilities of these agents require more proactive engagement, where agents should dynamically participate in conversations to clarify user intents, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to changing circumstances. Existing prior work under-utilize the conversational capabilities of language models (LMs), thereby optimizing agents as better followers rather than effective speakers. In this work, we introduce SpeakRL, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that enhances agents' conversational capabilities by rewarding proactive interactions with users, such as asking right clarification questions when necessary. To support this, we curate SpeakER, a synthetic dataset that includes diverse scenarios from task-oriented dialogues, where tasks are resolved through interactive clarification questions. We present a systematic analysis of reward design for conversational proactivity and propose a principled reward formulation for teaching agents to balance asking with acting. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves a 20.14% absolute improvement in task completion over base models without increasing conversation turns even surpassing even much larger proprietary models, demonstrating the promise of clarification-centric user-agent interactions.

Abstract: We introduce a finance & accounting benchmark (Finch) for evaluating AI agents on real-world, enterprise-grade professional workflows -- interleaving data entry, structuring, formatting, web search, cross-file retrieval, calculation, modeling, validation, translation, visualization, and reporting. Finch is sourced from authentic enterprise workspaces at Enron (15,000 spreadsheets and 500,000 emails from 150 employees) and other financial institutions, preserving in-the-wild messiness across multimodal artifacts (text, tables, formulas, charts, code, and images) and spanning diverse domains such as budgeting, trading, and asset management.
  We propose a workflow construction process that combines LLM-assisted discovery with expert annotation: (1) LLM-assisted, expert-verified derivation of workflows from real-world email threads and version histories of spreadsheet files, and (2) meticulous expert annotation for workflows, requiring over 700 hours of domain-expert effort. This yields 172 composite workflows with 384 tasks, involving 1,710 spreadsheets with 27 million cells, along with PDFs and other artifacts, capturing the intrinsically messy, long-horizon, knowledge-intensive, and collaborative nature of real-world enterprise work.
  We conduct both human and automated evaluations of frontier AI systems including GPT 5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Max, and GPT 5.1 Pro spends 48 hours in total yet passes only 38.4% of workflows, while Claude Sonnet 4.5 passes just 25.0%.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a lightweight and effective alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) for aligning large language and vision-language models. However, the standard DPO formulation, in which both the chosen and rejected responses are generated by the same policy, suffers from a weak learning signal because the two responses often share similar errors and exhibit small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This leads to slow and unstable convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Reflective Preference Optimization (RPO), a new framework that incorporates hint-guided reflection into the DPO paradigm. RPO uses external models to identify hallucination sources and generate concise reflective hints, enabling the construction of on-policy preference pairs with stronger contrastiveness and clearer preference signals. We theoretically show that conditioning on hints increases the expected preference margin through mutual information and improves sample efficiency while remaining within the policy distribution family. Empirically, RPO achieves superior alignment with fewer training samples and iterations, substantially reducing hallucination rates and delivering state-of-the-art performance across multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: In medical data analysis, extracting deep insights from complex, multi-modal datasets is essential for improving patient care, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing healthcare operations. However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in industrial agents capable of supporting analysts in regulated sectors, such as finance and healthcare, within tabular data workflows. A key capability for such systems is performing accurate arithmetic operations on structured data while ensuring sensitive information never leaves secure, on-premises environments. Here, we introduce an error-driven optimization framework for arithmetic reasoning that enhances a Code Generation Agent (CGA), specifically applied to on-premises small language models (SLMs). Through a systematic evaluation of a leading SLM (Qwen3 4B), we find that while the base model exhibits fundamental limitations in arithmetic tasks, our proposed error-driven method, which clusters erroneous predictions to refine prompt-rules iteratively, dramatically improves performance, elevating the model's accuracy to 70.8\%. Our results suggest that developing reliable, interpretable, and industrially deployable AI assistants can be achieved not only through costly fine-tuning but also via systematic, error-driven prompt optimization, enabling small models to surpass larger language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo) in a privacy-compliant manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new perspectives for automation in optimization. While several studies have explored how LLMs can generate or solve optimization models, far less is understood about what these models actually learn regarding problem structure or algorithmic behavior. This study investigates how LLMs internally represent combinatorial optimization problems and whether such representations can support downstream decision tasks. We adopt a twofold methodology combining direct querying, which assesses LLM capacity to explicitly extract instance features, with probing analyses that examine whether such information is implicitly encoded within their hidden layers. The probing framework is further extended to a per-instance algorithm selection task, evaluating whether LLM-derived representations can predict the best-performing solver. Experiments span four benchmark problems and three instance representations. Results show that LLMs exhibit moderate ability to recover feature information from problem instances, either through direct querying or probing. Notably, the predictive power of LLM hidden-layer representations proves comparable to that achieved through traditional feature extraction, suggesting that LLMs capture meaningful structural information relevant to optimization performance.

Abstract: The design of effective reward functions presents a central and often arduous challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when developing autonomous agents for complex reasoning tasks. While automated reward optimization approaches exist, they typically rely on derivative-free evolutionary heuristics that treat the reward function as a black box, failing to capture the causal relationship between reward structure and task performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL), a bilevel framework that enables the autonomous discovery of optimal reward signals. In DERL, a Meta-Optimizer evolves a reward function (i.e., Meta-Reward) by composing structured atomic primitives, guiding the training of an inner-loop policy. Crucially, unlike previous evolution, DERL is differentiable in its metaoptimization: it treats the inner-loop validation performance as a signal to update the Meta-Optimizer via reinforcement learning. This allows DERL to approximate the "meta-gradient" of task success, progressively learning to generate denser and more actionable feedback. We validate DERL across three distinct domains: robotic agent (ALFWorld), scientific simulation (ScienceWorld), and mathematical reasoning (GSM8k, MATH). Experimental results show that DERL achieves state-of-the-art performance on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld, significantly outperforming methods relying on heuristic rewards, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios. Analysis of the evolutionary trajectory demonstrates that DERL successfully captures the intrinsic structure of tasks, enabling selfimproving agent alignment without human intervention.

Abstract: Envy is a common human behavior that shapes competitiveness and can alter outcomes in team settings. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly act on behalf of humans in collaborative and competitive workflows, there is a pressing need to evaluate whether and under what conditions they exhibit envy-like preferences. In this paper, we test whether LLMs show envy-like behavior toward each other. We considered two scenarios: (1) A point allocation game that tests whether a model tries to win over its peer. (2) A workplace setting observing behaviour when recognition is unfair. Our findings reveal consistent evidence of envy-like patterns in certain LLMs, with large variation across models and contexts. For instance, GPT-5-mini and Claude-3.7-Sonnet show a clear tendency to pull down the peer model to equalize outcomes, whereas Mistral-Small-3.2-24B instead focuses on maximizing its own individual gains. These results highlight the need to consider competitive dispositions as a safety and design factor in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In recent years, hierarchical case-based-reasoning models of precedential constraint have been proposed. In various papers, Trevor Bench-Capon criticised these models on the grounds that they would give incorrect outcomes in some cases. In particular, the models would not account for the possibility that intermediate factors are established with different strengths by different base-level factors. In this paper we respond to these criticisms for van Woerkom's result-based hierarchical models. We argue that in some examples Bench-Capon seems to interpret intermediate factors as dimensions, and that applying van Woerkom's dimension-based version of the hierarchical result model to these examples avoids Bench-Capon's criticisms.

Abstract: Large language models with reasoning capabilities have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of domains. In clinical applications, a transparent, step-by-step reasoning process provides physicians with strong evidence to support decision-making. While reinforcement learning has effectively enhanced reasoning performance in medical contexts, the clinical reliability of these reasoning processes remains limited because their accuracy and validity are often overlooked during training. To address this gap, we propose MedCEG, a framework that augments medical language models with clinically valid reasoning pathways by explicitly supervising the reasoning process through a Critical Evidence Graph (CEG). We curate a dataset of challenging clinical cases and algorithmically construct a CEG for each sample to represent a high-quality verifiable reasoning pathway. To guide the reasoning process, we introduce a Clinical Reasoning Procedure Reward, which evaluates Node Coverage, Structural Correctness, and Chain Completeness, thereby providing a holistic assessment of reasoning quality. Experimental results show that MedCEG surpasses existing methods in performance while producing clinically valid reasoning chains, representing a solid advancement in reliable medical AI reasoning. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LinjieMu/MedCEG.
