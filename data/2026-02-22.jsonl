It is conceptually and technically distinct from the authors' earlier arXiv works (QTOW/QTOW2), which pursue different formulations of contextuality", "summary": "Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in classical probabilistic representations. Modeling contexts as interventions acting on a shared internal state, we prove that any classical model reproducing contextual outcome statistics must incur an irreducible information-theoretic cost: dependence on context cannot be mediated solely through the internal state. We provide a minimal constructive example that explicitly realizes this cost and clarifies its operational meaning. We further explain how nonclassical probabilistic frameworks avoid this obstruction by relaxing the assumption of a single global joint probability space, without invoking quantum dynamics or Hilbert space structure. Our results identify contextuality as a general representational constraint on adaptive intelligence, independent of physical implementation."}

Ismiel Hossen Abir"], "title": "A Conceptual Hybrid Framework for Post-Quantum Security: Integrating BB84 QKD, AES, and Bio-inspired Mechanisms", "comment": null, "summary": "Quantum computing is a significant risk to classical cryptographic, especially RSA, which depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Classical factorization methods, such as Trial Division and Pollard's Rho, are inefficient for large keys, while Shor's quantum algorithm can break RSA efficiently in polynomial time. This research studies RSA's vulnerabilities under both classical and quantum attacks and designs a hybrid security framework to ensure data protection in the post-quantum era. The conceptual framework combines AES encryption for classical security, BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for secure key exchange with eavesdropping detection, quantum state comparison for lightweight authentication, and a bio-inspired immune system for adaptive threat detection. RSA is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, BB84 achieves full key agreement in ideal conditions, and it detects eavesdropping with high accuracy. The conceptual model includes both classical and quantum security methods, providing a scalable and adaptive solution for Post-Quantum encryption data protection. This work primarily proposes a conceptual framework. Detailed implementation, security proofs, and extensive experimental validation are considered future work."}

Using commodity flatbed scanners and leave-one-painting-out cross-validation, the approach achieves 88.8% patch-level accuracy (86.7% painting-level via majority vote), outperforming texture-based and pretrained-feature baselines (68.0%-84.7%). For collaborative artworks, where ground truth is inherently ambiguous, we use conditional Shannon entropy to quantify stylistic overlap; manually annotated hybrid regions exhibit 64% higher uncertainty than pure paintings (p=0.003), suggesting the model detects mixed authorship rather than classification failure. The trained model is specific to this human-robot pair but provides a methodological grounding for sample-efficient attribution in data-scarce human-AI creative workflows that, in the future, has the potential to extend authorship attribution to any human-robot collaborative painting."}

LMMs are employed in two distinct roles: as subject models (SMs), which generate stories in response to TAT images, and as evaluator models (EMs), who assess these narratives using the SCORS-G framework. Evaluators demonstrated an excellent ability to understand and analyze TAT responses. Their interpretations are highly consistent with those of human experts. Assessment results highlight that all models understand interpersonal dynamics very well and have a good grasp of the concept of self.

A standard next-token prediction training strategy, while widely adopted in practice, may lead to overlooked artifacts such as representation collapse. Previous works have shown that this problem is especially pronounced in the representation of the deeper Transformer layers, where it often fails to efficiently utilize the geometric space. Representation collapse is even more evident in end-to-end training of continuous-output neural machine translation, where the trivial solution would be to set all vectors to the same value. In this work, we analyze the dynamics of representation collapse at different levels of discrete and continuous NMT transformers throughout training. We incorporate an existing regularization method based on angular dispersion and demonstrate empirically that it not only mitigates collapse but also improves translation quality. Furthermore, we show that quantized models exhibit similar collapse behavior and that the benefits of regularization are preserved even after quantization."}

In this study, we introduce RPDR, a novel data augmentation framework that selects high-quality easy-to-learn training data, to enhance dense retrievers. Our approach is built around three core components: synthetic data generation, data selection with Round-Trip prediction to identify easy-to-learn instances, and retriever training with these instances. We evaluate RPDR on two long-tail retrieval benchmarks, PopQA and EntityQuestion, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing retrievers like BM25 and Contriver, especially on extremely long-tail categories.

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour."}

Although token pruning has proven effective for accelerating inference, determining when and where to prune remains largely heuristic. Existing approaches typically rely on static, empirically selected layers, which limit interpretability and transferability across models. In this work, we introduce a matrix-entropy perspective and identify an \"Entropy Collapse Layer\" (ECL), where the information content of visual representations exhibits a sharp and consistent drop, which provides a principled criterion for selecting the pruning stage. Building on this observation, we propose EntropyPrune, a novel matrix-entropy-guided token pruning framework that quantifies the information value of individual visual tokens and prunes redundant ones without relying on attention maps. Moreover, to enable efficient computation, we exploit the spectral equivalence of dual Gram matrices, reducing the complexity of entropy computation and yielding up to a 64x theoretical speedup. Extensive experiments on diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that EntropyPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in both accuracy and efficiency. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method achieves a 68.2% reduction in FLOPs while preserving 96.0% of the original performance. Furthermore, EntropyPrune generalizes effectively to high-resolution and video-based models, highlighting the strong robustness and scalability in practical MLLM acceleration.

This lack of diversity not only restricts user choice, but also risks amplifying societal biases. In this work, we enhance the T2I diversity through a geometric lens. Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory. Our experiments on different frozen T2I backbones (U-Net and DiT, diffusion and flow) and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of disentangled diversity enhancement with minimal impact on image fidelity and semantic alignment."}

In financial advisory, however, observed actions can be noisy or short-sighted under market volatility and may conflict with a user's long-term goals. Treating what users chose as the sole ground truth, therefore, conflates behavioral imitation with decision quality. We introduce Conv-FinRe, a conversational and longitudinal benchmark for stock recommendation that evaluates LLMs beyond behavior matching. Given an onboarding interview, step-wise market context, and advisory dialogues, models must generate rankings over a fixed investment horizon. Crucially, Conv-FinRe provides multi-view references that distinguish descriptive behavior from normative utility grounded in investor-specific risk preferences, enabling diagnosis of whether an LLM follows rational analysis, mimics user noise, or is driven by market momentum. We build the benchmark from real market data and human decision trajectories, instantiate controlled advisory conversations, and evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal a persistent tension between rational decision quality and behavioral alignment: models that perform well on utility-based ranking often fail to match user choices, whereas behaviorally aligned models can overfit short-term noise. The dataset is publicly released on Hugging Face, and the codebase is available on GitHub."}

We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured \"20 Questions\" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen's d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry."}

We propose a simple bias-reduced evaluation protocol that replaces the labels of each question with uniform, unordered labels and prompts the LLM to use the whole answer presented. With a simple sentence similarity model, we demonstrate improved robustness and lower standard deviation between different permutations of answers with a minimal drop in LLM's performance, exposing the LLM's capabilities under reduced evaluation artifacts, without any help from the prompt examples or the option labels. Across multiple benchmarks and models, this protocol substantially improves the robustness to answer permutations, reducing mean accuracy variance $3\\times$ with only a minimal decrease in the mean model's performance. Through ablation studies on various embedding models and similarity functions, we show that the method is more robust than the standard ones."}

The statement compilation stage splits the document into atomic blocks, orders them via inferred dependencies, and repairs declaration skeletons until the project compiles, allowing placeholders in proofs. The proof repair stage closes these holes under fixed signatures using goal-conditioned local edits. Throughout both stages, M2F keeps the verifier in the loop, committing edits only when toolchain feedback confirms improvement. In approximately three weeks, M2F converts long-form mathematical sources into a project-scale Lean library of 153,853 lines from 479 pages textbooks on real analysis and convex analysis, fully formalized as Lean declarations with accompanying proofs. This represents textbook-scale formalization at a pace that would typically require months or years of expert effort.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support."}

When presented with instructions that lack strong scene-specific supervision, VLAs suffer from counterfactual failures: they act based on vision shortcuts induced by dataset biases, repeatedly executing well-learned behaviors and selecting objects frequently seen during training regardless of language intent. To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs. We propose Counterfactual Action Guidance (CAG), a simple yet effective dual-branch inference scheme that explicitly regularizes language conditioning in VLAs. CAG combines a standard VLA policy with a language-unconditioned Vision-Action (VA) module, enabling counterfactual comparison during action selection. This design reduces reliance on visual shortcuts, improves robustness on under-observed tasks, and requires neither additional demonstrations nor modifications to existing architectures or pretrained models. Extensive experiments demonstrate its plug-and-play integration across diverse VLAs and consistent improvements. For example, on LIBERO-CF, CAG improves $π_{0.5}$ by 9.7% in language following accuracy and 3.6% in task success on under-observed tasks using a training-free strategy, with further gains of 15.5% and 8.5%, respectively, when paired with a VA model. In real-world evaluations, CAG reduces counterfactual failures of 9.4% and improves task success by 17.2% on average."}
