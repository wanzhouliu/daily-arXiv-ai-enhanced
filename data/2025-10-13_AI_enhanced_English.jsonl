There are two main problems in the\ntask of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,\nexisting methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in\ncomplex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise\nrelationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in\nthe network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise\nrelationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy\nand data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification\nmethod for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to\naddress the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with\npairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the\nhigher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the\naccuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction\nmodule for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced\nto transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic\nevolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the\nphysical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure\nthat the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive\ndynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the\nprediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain\nnetwork datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper\nhas good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes a higher-order, physics-guided framework for long-term prediction of complex network dynamics by combining dynamic hypergraph learning with a Koopman- and physics-informed neural ODE module, achieving accurate and interpretable forecasts on public and industrial datasets.", "motivation": "Conventional graph models capture only pairwise relations and first-order GNNs struggle with non-pairwise (higher-order) interactions.

Benchmark:\n  https://huggingface.co/datasets/yzweak/PRBench", "summary": "As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on\nsocial platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in\npromoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this\nprocess and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic\nPromotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,\nengaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release\nPRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to\nhigh-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity\n(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment\n(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent\nframework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with\nmultimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and\nplatform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum\nreach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates\nsubstantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%\nrise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation\nstudies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most\nto these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research\nproblem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly\ncommunication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,\nis attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced\nSpeaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,\nreal-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for\nthinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a\n\"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate\n\"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor\neliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.\nExperiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing\nthink-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to\nmodels that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically\nreducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and\nattains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench.
